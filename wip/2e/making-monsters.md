### Monster Stat Block Format

X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X WIL, Attack (dX, special items, _qualities_)
- An engaging descriptor of appearance, demeanor, or living habits.
- A quirk, tactic, or peculiarity that distinguish this creature.
- Special effect or consequence of critical damage.

### Definitions

- **Hit Protection** is a creature's ability to avoid danger, whether through toughness, speed, or skill. Give average creatures 3 HP, give hardier ones 6 HP, and serious threats should get 10 HP or higher.
- **Armor**: For some creatures this represents their natural toughness, for others it may be from something that is worn or carried. If a creature is able to withstand an attack without moving, raise this number. 
- **Ability Scores**: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary. Adjust as necessary.
- **Strength**: Tracks overall health, physical power, and resistance to poisons. It is the ability of a creature to survive a direct hit, not its ability to avoid danger! 
- **Dexterity**: Start with **10** as a base, and if the creature is particularly quick, agile, or nimble increase the number as necessary. If it is slow to respond, bulky, or clumsy, lower the number.
- **Willpower**: Determines a creature's ability to withstand the influence of another, as well as their power over others. It also acts as a measurement of their defense in magical or spiritual matters.
- **Attacks**:
- **Abilities**:   

## Principles

- If an action can be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Attack and interacts with HP.
- If an action cannot be meaningfully avoided or defended against through traditional means, it is an Ability.
- If an Ability only affects a single PC it should generally have an immediate effect with no chance to Save in that round (possibly not at all).
- If an Ability is capable of affecting a group of PCs it should generally call for an immediate Save.
- Adjust based on what is fun and interesting.
- Use flavor and style to help them stand out. Players will remember a pig-faced humanoid looking for his missing sheep more easily than a generic goblin archer.
- Use **Critical Damage** to lean into the threat or strangeness of any aggressive NPC.
