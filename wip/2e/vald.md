# Vald

## Introduction

The implied setting of Cairn is called _Vald_, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, forests, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant, as the for the most part adventures will take place in smaller towns and villages, the forest, and the margins of the realm. 

## The Wood

The _Wood_ surrounds and divides the realm, including anyone or anything that does not swear fealty to the current regime. It is not one forest but _all_ forests. These regions are populated by creatures stranger and more wondrous than humankind, such as the Fae, demons, witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. The denizens of the Wood are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to its rules. Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting natural elements have kept armies and scouting parties at bay since time immemorial. Inhabitants of the Wood refer to anywhere outside their realm as the _Cities_, typically as a pejorative.

## The Roots

The _Roots_ is a realm of mystery and horror underground, indifferent to the petty divisions aboveground. These remnants of the _Old World_ consist of labyrinthine hollows stretching for immeasurable distances, connecting the sewers of the Cities to far-flung ruins beyond the borders. Entrances to the Roots, known as _Gates_, are scattered across the lands, usually protected or hidden. Only the brave or foolish dare enter in search of forgotten _Relics_ or powerful _Spellbooks_. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures. Folktales recount that traveling through the Roots bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries in the depths, only to emerge claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others claim to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling through the tunnels beneath.

## Factions

### Tideborn

A hierarchical religious sect that worships _Rivulus_, a petty god of rivers and lakes. Even the unaffiliated are familiar with the groupâ€™s initiation ceremony, a ritual drowning that occasionally kills participants. Survivors are dubbed _Tideborn_ and adopt a new, water-related moniker (Carp, Reed, Oxbow, and so on). Only clergy need participate in the ritual; however, in recent years, their following among the rural folk has increased, especially among villages near bodies of water. Within the clergy, there is little hierarchy, save for the _Aqua Primaris_, whom all obey implicitly.

The Tideborn are hardly the only faith in the realm, but their steady growth and zealotry have earned them the respect of some of the other factions, particularly the _House of Burgesses_. The continued expansion of their membership has, in turn, earned them some enemies, particularly from the more pious citizens of the Wood. Their enmity is such that today Tideborn clergy never attempt solitary travel through heavily wooded areas, lest they risk a beating, or worse.

### The House of Burgesses

An assembly of wealthy, land-owning lords and ladies. Cunning, assertive, and convinced of their own superiority, they can accomplish great things when acting as a single body. Unfortunately, their efforts are often undermined by individual squabbles, petty disputes, and their never-ending lust for power and prestige. Although there is a healthy distrust of the _Order of Nine_ in the House, a _Burgess_ will rarely speak ill of them in public. For their part, the House has remained neutral on the rise of the Tideborn, although internally there is much consternation regarding the upstart religion's recent increase in popularity.

### The Order of Nine

A consortium of merchants, scholars, and the very powerful, the Order relies on their substantial wealth and a vast network of spies to accomplish their aims. Their primary focus is on the discovery, identification, and regulation of Relics. In recent years, they've turned their focus onto the Roots, as they believe this to be the origin of most Relics and pay handsomely for any information regarding Gates. The organization owes its name to the founding members of the Order, whose names and titles are kept secret. The Order detests Spellbooks and any that carry them. They see little reason to openly engage in politics, yet keep spies in nearly every faction.

The Order employs several distinct ranks and titles (in order of primacy):
- _Lector_: An initiate is deemed a _Junior Lector_ until they've proven themselves, after which they are awarded the title of _High Lector_. Only the latter may use Relics in their work.
- _Keeper_: Protector of a Gate, akin to a typical soldier or mercenary.
- _Archivist_: A highly respected researcher or librarian, led by the _Grand Archivist_.
- _Chamberlain_: A master of Relics, charged with their protection, dispersal, and discovery.
- _Inquisitor_: The highest-ranking position within the Order, sharing power as a triumvirate (called the _Three_) and answering only to the _Nine_.

### The Marchguard

Beyond the Cities and beyond the Wood lies a place so wild, so dangerous, that only the extremely brave or extremely foolish dare set foot. The borders of these lands are ever-shifting, growing, and changing along with the passage of time. And so the Marchguard was born. No one can remember when the Guard was formed nor who worked to create it, but all know their purpose: to protect the realm from any incursions that might cross the boundary and to prevent those attempting to cross without guidance.

The Guard bends to no kings, knows no religion, and obeys no laws but their own. They lack even a central leadership, instead providing a masked volunteer to represent them in external negotiations. New members adopt a Blood Oath so powerful it is said to be inescapable by all but death itself. Of course, joining the Guard is rarely a choice, as their ranks are largely composed of ex-thugs, disgraced scholars, neglected knights, misbegotten rangers, and the like. This is how it must be, of course. For who else would willingly devote their lives to stand against such unknowable horrors?

Bloodhounds are members of the Guard who have been awarded special commendations or have demonstrated true belief in their cause. Though this distinction carries no rank, they are no less respected or feared. These hunters have adopted a single purpose of duty: enforcing the Oath. Utilizing a network of spies, informants, and plants, they ensure that any who escape the Guard are forced to return or die in their attempt.

The Guard sees little reason to engage in politics or other such short-sighted quarrels with the other factions. However, decades of living near the borders have brokered an uneasy friendship with the peoples of the Wood, whom they will treat with on a regular basis. And although it is rarely discussed, the Guard will come to their aid as well.
