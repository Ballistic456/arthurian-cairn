# Vald

## Introduction

The implied setting of Cairn is called _Vald_, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, forests, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant, as the for the most part adventures will take place in smaller towns and villages, the forest, and the margins of the realm. Most inhabitants (regardless of region) refer to the local centers of power as the _Cities_, occasionally as a pejorative.

### The Wood

The _Wood_ surrounds and divides the realm, including anyone or anything that does not swear fealty to the current regime. It is not one forest but _all_ forests. These regions are populated by creatures stranger and more wondrous than humankind, such as the Fae, demons, witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. Denizens of the Wood are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to its rules. Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting natural elements have kept armies and scouting parties at bay since time immemorial.

### The Roots

The _Roots_ is a realm of mystery and horror underground, indifferent to the petty divisions aboveground. These remnants of the _Old World_ consist of labyrinthine hollows stretching for immeasurable distances, connecting the sewers of the Cities to far-flung ruins beyond the borders. Entrances to the Roots, known as _Gates_, are scattered across the lands, usually protected or hidden. Only the brave or foolish dare enter in search of forgotten _Relics_ or powerful _Spellbooks_. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures. Folktales recount that traveling through the Roots bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries in the depths, only to emerge claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others claim to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling through the tunnels beneath.

## Factions

### Tideborn

A hierarchical religious sect that worships _Rivulus_, a petty god of rivers and lakes. Even the unaffiliated are familiar with the groupâ€™s initiation ceremony, a ritual drowning that occasionally kills participants. Survivors are dubbed _Tideborn_ and adopt a new, water-related moniker (Carp, Reed, Oxbow, and so on). Only clergy need participate in the ritual; however, in recent years, their following among the rural folk has increased, especially among villages near bodies of water. Within the clergy, there is little hierarchy, save for the _Aqua Primaris_, whom all obey implicitly.

The Tideborn are hardly the only faith in the realm, but their steady growth and zealotry have earned them the respect of some of the other factions, particularly the _House of Burgesses_. The continued expansion of their membership has, in turn, earned them some enemies, particularly from the more pious citizens of the Wood. Their enmity is such that today Tideborn clergy never attempt solitary travel through heavily wooded areas, lest they risk a beating, or worse.

### The House of Burgesses

An assembly of wealthy, land-owning lords and ladies. Cunning, assertive, and convinced of their own superiority, they can accomplish great things when acting as a single body. Unfortunately, their efforts are often undermined by individual squabbles, petty disputes, and their never-ending lust for power and prestige. Although there is a healthy distrust of the _Order of Nine_ in the House, a _Burgess_ will rarely speak ill of them in public. For their part, the House has remained neutral on the rise of the Tideborn, although internally there is much consternation regarding the upstart religion's recent increase in popularity.

### The Order of Nine

A consortium of merchants, scholars, and the very powerful, the Order relies on their substantial wealth and a vast network of spies to accomplish their aims. Their primary focus is on the discovery, identification, and regulation of Relics. In recent years, they've turned their focus onto the Roots, as they believe this to be the origin of most Relics and pay handsomely for any information regarding Gates. The organization owes its name to the founding members of the Order, whose names and titles are kept secret. The Order detests Spellbooks and any that carry them. They see little reason to openly engage in politics, yet keep spies in nearly every faction.

The Order employs several distinct ranks and titles (in order of primacy):
- _Lector_: An initiate is deemed a _Junior Lector_ until they've proven themselves, after which they are awarded the title of _High Lector_. Only the latter may use Relics in their work.
- _Keeper_: Protector of a Gate, akin to a typical soldier or mercenary.
- _Archivist_: A highly respected researcher or librarian, led by the _Grand Archivist_.
- _Chamberlain_: A master of Relics, charged with their protection, dispersal, and discovery.
- _Inquisitor_: The highest-ranking position within the Order, sharing power as a triumvirate (called the _Three_) and answering only to the _Nine_.

### The Marchguard

At the margins of the realm and beyond the Wood lies a place so wild, so dangerous, that only the extremely brave or extremely foolish dare set foot. The borders of these lands are ever-shifting, growing, and changing along with the passage of time. And so the Marchguard was born. No one can remember when the Guard was formed nor who worked to create it, but all know their purpose: to protect the realm from any incursions that might cross the boundary and to prevent those attempting to cross without guidance.

The Guard bends to no kings, knows no religion, and obeys no laws but their own. They lack even a central leadership, instead providing a masked volunteer to represent them in external negotiations. New members adopt a Blood Oath so powerful it is said to be inescapable by all but death itself. Of course, joining the Guard is rarely a choice, as their ranks are largely composed of ex-thugs, disgraced scholars, neglected knights, misbegotten rangers, and the like. This is how it must be, of course. For who else would willingly devote their lives to stand against such unknowable horrors?

Bloodhounds are members of the Guard who have been awarded special commendations or have demonstrated true belief in their cause. Though this distinction carries no rank, they are no less respected or feared. These hunters have adopted a single purpose of duty: enforcing the Oath. Utilizing a network of spies, informants, and plants, they ensure that any who escape the Guard are forced to return or die in their attempt.

The Guard sees little reason to engage in politics or other such short-sighted quarrels with the other factions. However, decades of living near the borders have brokered an uneasy friendship with those who call the Wood their home, and will even treat with them on occasion. And although it is never discussed, on rare occasions the Guard will come to their aid as well.

### The Neighbors

Through the bramble and over the bush, there is a liminal space where the realms of mortals and the Faerie touch. If you look for it, you will not find it. But if you need to pass over, you will. The creatures that inhabit this place may look and sound familiar, but make no mistake: they are not like you. Tall, slender, pale as ice, and eerily beautiful, the Fae obey no mortal law, nor do they submit to its morality. And yet, they are crippled by sterility, lacking the ability to create their own kindred. For this deed, they must cross the threshold into the mortal realm to treat with mortals. There are many names for their kind, but only one has truly stuck: Neighbors.

There are some who say the Neighbors steal babes from their cribs, replacing them with a Changeling child. Others claim that they will pay great sums of wealth or bestow enormous power to those willing to give away their own flesh and blood. There is one truth that all agree on: to make deals with their kind is to invite ill luck not only to your life but that of your descendants as well.

Hunters swear that occasionally animals from the Faerie world will pass into ours, a white blaze burnt into their fur. They say that their meat is the sweetest you will ever taste and that afterward you will starve by the lack of it. Worse, to be caught poaching these creatures is a fate worse than death. Scholars have written that the Neighbors can spill magic as if it were water, having no need for Spellbooks, or even Relics. They also claim that all magic has its origin in the land of the Pale Folk, and that within each Spellbook is the trapped spirit of their most craven lawbreakers.

Those who make their lives in the Wood know to carry charms, gifts, and similar items in case of a chance meeting. And though the Neighbors rarely trouble the borders to their kingdom, they have been known to deliver harsh punishment to those that cross their boundary uninvited. However, it is common knowledge that the Neighbors are terrified of the Roots, and will avoid Gates whenever possible.
