# Vald

## Introduction

- The implied setting of Cairn is called **Vald**, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant.
- **The Wood** surrounds and divides the kingdoms, including anyone or anything that has not yet sworn fealty. It is not one forest but _all_ forests.
- **The Roots** is the realm of mystery and horror underneath, indifferent to the petty divisions aboveground.

### The Wood

- Any lands beyond the control of a noble, city, or town. Typically wilder and less "civilized." All forests are part of **The Wood**, regardless of isolation.
- Populated by creatures stranger and more wondrous than humankind: Fae, Demons, Witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. They do not appreciate losing their home to "natural" progress.
- The denizens of **The Wood** are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to the rules of **The Wood**. Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting elements have kept armies and scouting parties at bay.

### The Roots

- Remnants of the **Old World**, its labyrinthine hollows stretch for immeasurable distances deep underground, connecting the sewers of the cities to far-flung ruins. Entrances to **The Roots** (called **Gates**) are scattered across the lands, usually protected or hidden.
- Only the brave or foolish dare enter **The Roots** in search of forgotten **Relics** or powerful **Spellbooks**. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures.
- Folktales recount that traveling through **The Roots** bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries to the depths, only to emerge claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others claim to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling through the tunnels beneath.

### Factions

#### The Order of Nine

A consortium of merchants, scholars, and the very powerful that rely on their substantial wealth and a vast network of spies to accomplish their aims. Their primary focus is on the discovery, identification, and regulation of Gates. They believe that Relics are deeply tied to the Roots and will pay handsomely for information relating to either.

#### Tideborn

A hierarchical religious sect that worships _Rivulus_, god of Rivers and Lakes. Even the unaffiliated are familiar with the group’s initiation ceremony, a ritual drowning that occasionally kills participants. Survivors are dubbed “Tideborn” and adopt a new, water-related moniker (Carp, Reed, Oxbow, and so on). Only clergy need participate in the ritual, however, and in recent years their following among the rural folk has increased, especially among villages near bodies of water.

#### The House of Burgesses

An assembly of rich, land-owning lords and ladies. Cunning, assertive, and convinced of their own superiority, they can accomplish great things when acting as a single body. Unfortunately, their efforts are often undermined by individual squabbles, petty disputes, and their never-ending lust for power and prestige.

#### The Marchguard

Beyond the Cities and beyond the Wood lies a place so wild, so dangerous, that only the extremely brave or extremely foolish dare set foot. The borders to these lands are ever-shifting, growing, and changing along with the passage of time. And so the Marchguard was born. No one can remember when the Guard was formed nor who worked to create it. But all know their purpose: to protect the realm from any incursions that might cross the boundary and to prevent those attempting to cross without guidance.

The Guard bends to no kings, knows no religion, and obeys no laws but their own. They lack even a central leadership, instead providing a masked volunteer to represent them in external negotiations. New members adopt a Blood Oath so powerful it is said to be inescapable by all but death itself. Of course, joining the Guard is rarely a choice, as their ranks are largely comprised of ex-thugs, disgraced scholars, neglected knights, misbegotten rangers, and the like. This is how it must be, of course. For who else would willingly devote their lives to stand against such unknowable horrors?

_Bloodhounds_ are members of the Guard who have been awarded special commendations or have demonstrated true belief in their cause. Though this distinction carries no rank, they are no less respected or feared. These hunters have adopted a single purpose of duty: enforcing the Oath. Utilizing a network of spies, informants, and plants, they ensure that any who escape the Guard are forced to return or die in their attempt.
