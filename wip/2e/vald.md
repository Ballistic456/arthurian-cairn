# Vald

## Introduction

- The implied setting of Cairn is called **Vald**, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant.
- **The Wood** surrounds and divides the kingdoms, including anyone or anything that has not yet sworn fealty. It is not one forest but _all_ forests.
- **The Roots** is the realm of mystery and horror underneath, indifferent to the petty divisions aboveground.

### The Wood

- Any lands beyond the control of a noble, city, or town. Typically wilder and less "civilized." All forests are part of **The Wood**, regardless of isolation.
- Populated by creatures stranger and more wondrous than humankind: Fae, Demons, Witches, werewolves, and even talking plants and animals. They do not appreciate losing their home to "natural" progress.
- The denizens of **The Wood** are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to the rules of **The Wood**. Its fierce nations, wild tribes, and unrelenting elements have kept armies and scouting parties at bay.

### The Roots

- Remnants of the **Old World**, its labyrinthine hollows stretch for immeasurable distances deep underground, connecting the sewers of the cities to far-flung ruins. Entrances to **The Roots** (called **Gates**) are scattered across the lands, usually protected or hidden.
- Only the brave or foolish dare enter **The Roots** in search of forgotten **Relics** or powerful **Spellbooks**. The few that return whisper of unspeakable terrors guarding these lost treasures.
- Folktales recount that traveling through **The Roots** bends the natural order of things. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries to the depths, only to emerge claiming that only a few hours have passed. Others claim to make a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling through the tunnels beneath.
