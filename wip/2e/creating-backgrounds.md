# Creating Backgrounds

- Introduction
- Principles
- Anatomy of a Background
- A Background For Your Setting
- Bonds & Omens

## Introduction

In Cairn a PC's background is the most important element of their character, representing their past as well their present. Backgrounds can influence a character's knowledge, expertise, their connection with the setting, and much more. Backgrounds are also a filter for interpreting the results of a dice roll, or a reason to not roll at all. A Greenwise doesn't need to save DEX when cutting leaves from a poisonous plant, just as a Scrivener knows how to read the older form of a local tongue. Most importantly, backgrounds tell a story through the character's starting gear and unique history, connecting the PC to a setting and its themes.

## Principles

- Players should be excited about rolling on the background tables.
- Backgrounds can be archetypal and familiar, but leave room for alternative interpretations!
- Backgrounds should tell the player something about the implied setting.
- Table results should be unique from one another so that characters with the same background are still distinct from one another.

## Anatomy of a Background

### Theme

### Starting Gear

Characters in Cairn are largely defined by their inventory, and a backgrounds starting gear is an excellent place to start painting its unique canvas. 
- Excluding gold pieces, each background should have a total of 6 default items. 
- Default items should include gold, food, and a light source. That doesn't mean they all need be the same! A background could start with extra Rations, an unusual lantern (and oil), and so on. 
- Each unique starting item should reinforce the overarching theme of the character and the setting whenever possible.
- Starting items should occupy no more than seven slots in inventory so as to not overburden starting characters.

## Tables

One table is "who you were" or "what made you" and could be either an item or a skill (or both), and the other is "what defines you now."
