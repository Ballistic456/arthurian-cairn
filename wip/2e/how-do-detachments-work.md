# How Do Detachments Work?

> **Wolfram**, **Lucius**, and **Freya** are on the run from a _detachment_ of twelve city guards [4 HP, 1 Armor, 11 STR, 14 DEX, 12 WIL, short sword (d6)], taking shelter in a burnt out old outpost at the edge of a forest. The soldiers each carry a short sword and bow, except for their leader, a tall man with a bright blue epaulet on his shoulder. The soldiers know that the party have taken refuge in the outpost, and are talking amongst themselves at a safe distance away, just North of where the party is hunkering down. The _detachment_ will be treated as a single entity until they take **Critical Damage**.

**Warden**: _"The outpost is partly shielded by what remains of its walls, and through the slats you see the soldiers split off: six head towards the Southwest adjacent the treeline, while the rest (including the tall man) move Southeast, where the walls are the most damaged. It looks like they are planning some kind of pincer attack. Based on their current speed, you have less than a minute to act before they reach the open-side of the shield wall surrounding the outpost, where you'll be sitting ducks! What do you do?"_

**Wolfram**: _"I was in the military, so I know how this goes. That man with the fancy tassel is their leader. If we take him out, the rest might flee. I'm going to wait until he is as close as possible, then fire my crossbow at him. If that leaves me exposed, then so be it!"_

**Lucius**: _"You're always so direct, Wolfie! I'm going to pour some of my famous Miracle Oil on the ladder leading up here. That should both prove effective and entertaining!"_

**Freya**: _"And what exactly will stop them from simply firing into our hiding spot from the giant holes on the South side? At the very best, they'll just wait until we run out of food. I have another idea: I'll poke my head through the trapdoor and toss  Smoke Bombs towards each side of the building. That'll give us an advantage for when these other two plans inevitably fail!_

**Lucius**: _"Uh, I guess I'll do that just after she tosses the Smoke Bombs, then?"_

**Warden**: _"That should be fine, yes. But be aware that combat officially breaks out as soon as Lucius stands to fire. And since you're all at the ready, there is no need to make a DEX save: you go first._

**Everyone**: _"Understood."_

> **Player's Turn**

**Warden**: _"The soldiers continue their trajectory, until finally the Leader draws his sword into the air and screams, "Charge! And the soldiers rush towards you. Everything happens at once. Wolfram stands and fires his crossbow at the leader. Since the leader is part of a detachment, Wolfram can only roll a d4."_

> The result of Wofram's attack is a 3, and as the leader's helmet absorbs 1 point of damage he loses only 2 HP.

**Warden**: _"The arrow whizzes past the leader's shoulder, tearing his brightly-colored shoulder epaulet. He grimaces and rushes forward towards the East side of the building. Freya, at the same time you pop your head through the trap door and toss Smoke Bombs on the East and West sides of the building - mark off 2 uses please. Lucius, you stand behind her, and the moment she moves away, you pour some Miracle Oil on the stepladder."_

> **Opponent's Turn**

**Warden**: _As smoke fills either side of the building, you lose sight of the soldiers. It becomes impossible to tell friend from foe, and even their leader disappears in the chaos. A few of the men try to climb the ladder but slide off, landing at the bottom in a heap. Your enemies have essentially lost their turn, but the smoke is starting to dissipate. Amidst coughing and shouts you hear the leader's voice: 'Burn it to the ground!'"_

> **Player's Turn**

**Wolfram**: _"Well that bought us some time, at least. Hey Lucius, how flammable is that oil of yours?"_

**Lucius**: _"Very. And it seems we may be running out of options."_

**Freya**: _"Well, it's been fun, but I'd rather die fighting down there than get burned alive up here with you lot! No offense."_

**Wolfram**: _"None taken. See if you can take out their leader while we try open up an escape route."_

**Wolfram**: _"I'm going to cast Disassemble on myself, then scream 'he's going to tear my arms off!' I will then drop down to the ground and start running around in circles. Lucius, when my arms are removed, I want you to pick them up and come after me. That ought to freak them out!"_

**Lucius**: _"OK. I really hope this works... And if not, well at least we'll go down fighting! Or screaming. Probably the latter."_

**Warden**: _"Freya, who will you be your target and with what weapon?"_

**Freya**: _"Their leader, and I'll be using The Twins._"

**Warden**: _"Alright. Freya leaps down to the smokey earth, making a beeline for the leader. She draws her twin daggers, but as she is still attacking a detachment she must still roll only a d4 for each."_

> Freya makes two d4 rolls, a 4 and a 1. She keeps the higher, and the leader's helmet again absorbs 1 point of damage. The remaining three damage is enough to trigger a **Critical Damage** save on the behalf of the detachment. The result is a 15 (a fail) and with the defeat of their leader is both broken and routed.

**Warden**: _"Freya slashes at the leader with one dagger, but it just misses as the man takes a lucky step back. He is far less fortunate On her second attack however, as she stabs the man in the chest. He slumps over, and those closest to him shout in surprise, some even begin backing away. It is at this moment that you hear a scream, and then from the outpost see Wolfram leap onto the ground and begin running in circles like a chicken, followed by Lucius holding both of his friend's arms. The others then pick up their leader and hightail it back to the edge of the hill amid screams of 'They're monsters!' and 'We weren't trained for this!'"_ 

**Wolfram**: _"See, I told you it would work!"_

**Freya**: _"I'm pretty sure this was all me, but whatever._"

**Lucius** _"Who cares? Let's just get out of here while the getting's good._"

**Warden** _"You have an opportunity to flee into the nearby woods, or across the open fields if you think you can run fast enough. What do you do?"_
