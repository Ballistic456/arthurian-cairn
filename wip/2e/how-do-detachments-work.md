# How Do Detachments Work?



A squad of six soldiers is firing arrows at the party's hiding spot, near a small outpost. The party consists of an experienced hunter (with a bow), two former outlaws (throwing knives and a long sword, respectively) and a disgruntled former priest (spellbook: Haste).

Each soldier is armored, and equipped with a short bow and a short sword, save the leader who carries a long sword of alien quality. After their arrows fall short, the group splits up, circling the outpost from both sides in a pincer maneuver.

**Warden**: "The outpost is partly shielded by wood, but you must crouch to avoid getting hit by arrows. Through the slats you see the soldiers split off, widening the distance between (3 in each, the Leader following the Westward group (to your right).  Based on their current speed, you have less than a minute to act before they reach the open-side of the shield wall surrounding the outpost, where you'll be a sitting duck!"

**Hunter**: "Alright, I'm going wait until the leader is as close as possible, then fire down from above. If that leaves me open to their arrows, so be it. We've got to take him out - perhaps the rest will scatter!"

**Outlaws**: "We'll scatter caltrops at the base of the outpost near the ladder, and get ready to toss oil on whomever tries to climb up. Otherwise we'll leap off [DEX save] if anyone gets in firing range. We don't want to be sitting ducks!"

> Note: The outlaws are twins. Deal with it.

**Cleric**: (fumbling through his things) "Leave me to die, will you? Fine. I'll prepare to use that damnable book again if it helps me get the hell out of this place as quickly as possible!" 

**Warden**: "The soldiers continue their trajectory, carefully prepared to fire on anyone who approaches. The Leader draws his sword into the air and screams, "Charge!"

Everything happens at once.

First, the Hunter stands and fires his arrows at the leader. Since the leader is part of a detachment, instead of the typical d6, he only rolls a d4. It strikes the Leader for 3 damage, taking away 1 HP (he had 2 Armor)!. The arrow whizzes past the leader's shoulder, tearing his brightly-colored shoulder tassle. He grimaces and rushes straight ahead, towards the outpost.

At the same time, the Twins scatter their caltrops at the base of the half-shielded outpost. They both pause as the soldiers approach, waiting to see what happens before they jump over the wall.
Finally, the disgraced Cleric opens his Haste spell in both hands, and mumbles the phrases form the page. Instantly, he becomes a blur, moving off the outpost at a blinding speed. He zooms past the ladder, the caltrops and the oncoming soldiers and into the safety of the forest behind them. He takes one Fatigue, using up 9 out of 10 inventory slots. 

[Enemy turn] 

Luck Roll to determine if the leader would check the caltrops before running - a 6. He does not, nor does anyone else.

The leader steps on the caltrops, taking d4 STR damage - he loses 1 STR, but shrugs it off quickly. He climbs the ladder,  only to be buffeted in the face by the ready-to-attack oil-wielding twin, who loses his chance to jump away. The oil does d10 damage (blast) which negates the impaired property. It does 8 damage to the leader, though no other soldiers are close enough to feel the effect. He screams in agony, making a critical damage save. He fails, and falls to the ground onto the waiting caltrops. His face burns first.

The other twin makes leaps off the side after a successful DEX save, landing on the ground behind three of the soldiers from the East-bound pincer group. 

Remaining soldiers: Their "side" makes a WIL save using their leader's WIL score. It is a fail.
[At this point you could make an optional luck roll to see how many scatter. Let's just say it's all but the two that turn to face the jumping twin] 

The remaining two soldiers turn around to flee, but run smack into the just-rising-off-the-ground twin. He guts the first (d6/5 damage, skipping HP) because he was surprised. He succeeds the critical damage save. The other reacts (it's technically his turn) by slamming his ready bow into the twin's face (d4/2 damage to HP).

[PC turn - you know what happens here. The remaining soldiers are probably gonna die]
