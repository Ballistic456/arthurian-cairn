# How Do Saves Work?

## Overview

## When to Save

There are three common scenarios in which a player character should **save**:
-  When avoiding the negative outcome of a risky action.
-  When acting in opposition to another player character, NPC, or creature.
-  When aiding one or more characters in a risky action. 

## Principles for Saves

- When in doubt, ask whether the party has the time, resources, skills, or advantage to overcome a problem. If the answer is "no," then a Save is usually warranted. If the answer is "I don't know" then a roll with the Die of Fate may be necessary.
- Feel free to say "no," but remember to offer an alternative. If the party cannot proceed due to circumstances beyond their control, give them another option to consider.
- Death should always be a choice. If the risk is so great that the outcome might be fatal, make sure the player understands what they're getting into.
- In order for agency to exist, there _must_ be multiple viable options that the PCs can choose from. The more choices, the more interesting the situation becomes.
- The outcome of a Save need not be a simple binary. You can tailor the results based on the totality of input: the effort, forethought, resources, and skill that went into the roll.
- Be transparent with players. This doesn't mean revealing all of the world's secrets, but provide each player with the maximum information their character might have.
- Avoid requiring a dice roll whenever possible. If a PC can solve a problem using purely narrative components, _do not ask for a roll_.
- Replace multiple dice rolls with a single dice throw. Simplifying results to a single roll can increase tension while maximizing player input.
