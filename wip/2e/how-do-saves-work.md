# How Do Saves Work?

## Overview

## When to Save

There are three common scenarios in which a player character should **save**:
-  When avoiding the negative outcome of a risky action.
-  When acting in opposition to another player character, NPC, or creature.
-  When aiding one or more characters in a risky action. 

## Principles for Saves

- When in doubt, ask whether the party has the time, resources, skills, or advantage to overcome a problem. If the answer is "no," then a Save is usually warranted. If the answer is "I don't know" then a roll with the Die of Fate may be necessary.
- Feel free to say "no," but remember to offer an alternative. If the party cannot proceed due to circumstances beyond their control, give them another option to consider.
- Character death should never come as a surprise. If the risk is so great that the outcome might be fatal, make sure the player understands what they're getting into.
- Always provide _must_ multiple viable options for the PCs to choose from. The more choices, the more interesting the situation becomes.
- The outcome of a Save need not be a simple binary. You can tailor the results based on the totality of input: the effort, forethought, resources, and skill that went into the roll.
- Be transparent with players. This doesn't mean revealing all of the world's secrets, but provide each player with the maximum information their character might have.
- Avoid requiring a dice roll whenever possible. If a PC can solve a problem using purely narrative components, _do not ask for a roll_.
- Replace multiple dice rolls with a single dice throw. Simplifying results to a single roll can increase tension while maximizing player input. 

## Opposed Saves

> The party has cornered their opponents (two Bandits and their Hobgoblin chief) against a steep cliff side. Lucius and Wolfram are able to take their turns right away, but Lucius failed her initial DEX save and has to go after their opponents. As her friends take on each of their smaller foes, she only narrowly avoids getting her head bashed in by the Hobgoblin!

**Freya**: _"I don't think I can survive another bout with their leader, so I'm going to try and knock him off the cliff!"_

**Warden**: _"You are most at risk in this situation, meaning that if you try and push him you will need to make the appropriate Save!"_

**Freya**: _"And if I fail, I go off the cliff, right? Alright.. I think I can do this. But just in case, I'm going to make sure I'm wearing my Catring!"_

> Freya rolls a STR save to try and grapple the Hobgoblin and toss him off the cliff. She rolls a 17, a fail!

**Warden**: _"Their leader picks you up by the back and flips you over his head, sending you careening off the cliff. Fortunately the Catring activities its final charge, and you are able to gracefully catch a tree branch jutting off the mountainside 10ft below. It will take you two turns to climb back up, or you'll need to make a DEX save to do it quickly._"

**Freya**: _"Damn. Well, hopefully my comrades will fare well enough without me until I return..."_
