# How Do Saves Work?

## Overview

## When to Save

There are three common scenarios in which a player character should **save**:
-  When avoiding the negative outcome of a risky action.
-  When acting in opposition to another player character, NPC, or creature.
-  When aiding one or more characters in a risky action. 

When in doubt, ask whether the party has the time, resources, skills, or advantage to overcome a problem. If the answer is "no," then a Save is usually warranted. If the answer is "I don't know" then a roll with the Die of Fate may be necessary.
