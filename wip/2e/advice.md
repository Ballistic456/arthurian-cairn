# Advice

## Wilderness Exploration

You might have something like this, a journey between two POIs, with Easy terrain and on a Trail:
- ** Travel Distance**: 2 Watches in good weather.
- **Weather**: Raining. 
- Watch one: Travel on a trail across a grassy plain. _The party did not get lost._
 - [Events Table]: **Sign**. One of the party members looks around after traversing a small hillock, and spies something glittering in the distance behind them. It disappears after a few seconds. Could that be a spyglass, reflecting in the sun?
- Watch two: Travel continues on the same trail and plain. _The party did not get lost._
 - [Events Table]: **Environment**. The weather has worsened in the evening, and as a result the plain is muddy and the trail harder to follow.  The party is forced to slow their march considerably, only reaching the the edge of the grasses at nightfall. They are forced to find shelter in the open plain rather than at their destination in the adjacent forest.
- Watch three: Make Camp. The party sets up a hastily-made shelter and each member consumes a ration. A lookout rotation is set (there are four party members), and the other three go to sleep. 
 - [Events Table]: **Sign**. The sky clears up enough for the first guard to see a light in the distance, flickering slowly. A campfire! Someone is definitely following them.

## Dungeon Exploration

### Dungeon Exploration Example

A party of 3 player characters (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) have entered the first level of the forest ruins of **Ein Eyton**, once the home of the death-cult **Lunheuzo**. Each character has a torch, but only **Leib** has one lit. There are no light sources here beyond the Moon in the night sky. The **Warden** reads the first room's description:  

### The Courtyard

A wide courtyard completely exposed to the **open air**. The **ground** is sandy and rough. **Rubble** is piled near the center of the room. A full-sized **statue** holding a bident is placed in the exact center. A wooden **doorway** to the East is locked with an iron chain. An open stone archway leads towards the West.

- **Air**: The roof has collapsed, letting exterior lighting illuminate the room. 
- **Ground**: Glitters in the light. A cursory investigation will reveal that the "sand" is actually pulverized bones.  
- **Rubble**: Stones chunks of very realistic-looking people. 
  - A red jewel glints within a tight stone fist.  
- **Statue**: One eye socket is empty, in the other is a red jewel.    
  - The cult's Death Goddess, marred by time.
  - If the remaining eye is removed, the statue comes to life with ferocity, slicing the bident in an arc for d6 STR damage. Contact with the bident turns the victim to stone.  
- **Doorway**: The door to the Storeroom has nearly rotted away, leaving cracks in the wood. The iron chain is clearly rusted.

The **Warden** describes the room as "_A wide courtyard. Moonlight drifts through the collapsed roof from the night sky. The floor is sandy, chalk-white that sparkles in the moonlight. Rubble is piled in the center near a statue of a woman holding a bladed weapon. There is a closed wooden door on the **East** side, and an open archway into a dark tunnel to the **West**."_

[**The characters then declare their intended actions.**]    
**Leib**: _"I'll search the room for clues about its purpose, starting with that glittery ground."_ 
**Konstin**: _"I'll check out the wooden **door**. What can you tell me about it?"_ 
**Gar**: "_I'm going to get a better look at that **statue**. What can I learn without actually getting too close?"_ 

**Warden**: _"Alright, let's start with **Leib**. The sand is white, grainy, and clearly not from any beach 'round these parts. Starting at a small lump in the ground, you recognize a half-decayed human skull, meaning that this "sand" is actually bone! What do you do now?"_

**Leib**: _"Gross. I'm gonna poke at it a bit with my sword. Is there is anything hidden in the dust? Something valuable, maybe?"_

**Warden**: _"No. But you're at least convinced the ground is safe. And that's the end of your turn!"_

> **The Warden then moves to describe another character's actions, as they are happening simultaneously.**

**Warden**: "Let's see what **Gar** is up to."_

**Gar**: _"I step a bit closer to that statue. I'd like to take a look, but I don't want to get too close."_

**Warden**: _"You step about five feet away from the Statue. Her face looks chipped away, and one of its eyes is missing entirely. Embedded in the other however is a beautiful red jewel! In its hands it holds a bident made of white stone. Do you interact with the statue further, or move along?"_

**Gar**: _"That's just creepy! I want no part in this, at least not until we learn more about what this room was for. I'd like to investigate that rubble you mentioned before."_ 

**Warden**: _"The rubble looks extremely heavy, and difficult to move. In the light from **Leib's** torch you can see something red and shiny glinting in the cracks of the pile. What do you do?"_

**Gar**: _"I dig it out, of course! But carefully."_

**Warden**: _"You move some of the rubble aside, and spy a red jewel enclosed in a stone fist. The fingers are wrapped around it quite tightly; you'll need to work hard to get it loose!"_

**Gar**: _"Damn. Fine, I'm going to chisel away at with the edge of my dagger and a block of rubble. Noise be damned!_"

**Warden**: _"OK, you do that. It makes a lot of noise, but eventually the jewel comes lose. It takes up one slot, and looks worth about 75gp."_

> **The Warden then rolls on the Dungeon Events table: a Loss.**

**Warden**: _"A great surge of wind rushes into the courtyard from the exposed roof. **Leib's** torch is blown out, but the moonlight is sufficient to protect the party from making a **Panic** roll."_

**Leib**: _"I'll mark off another use of my torch and relight it, if that's OK_"

**Warden**: _"That's fine. Let's move on. "**Konstin**, the **door** is locked, ancient, and partly rotted away. It bears a rusted iron lock. What do you do now?"_

**Konstin**: _"As I have no lockpick, I think I'll put my ear to the door to see what's on the other side."_ 

**Warden**: _"OK, doing that will finish out your **turn**. 

> **The Warden now describes the results of each character's choices.**

**Warden**: _"**Konstin** places an ear on the door, but hears only a faint rustling on the other side._"

**Konstin**: _"How busted is the keyhole? Could I see through it? What about the door itself? You said it was rotted._"

**Warden**: _"The keyhole is intact, and too dark to look through. You could shine a light through it, or you could use one of the gaps in the door."_

**Konstin**: _"That works. I light my **torch** and hold it aloft so that I can see through."_

**Warden**: _"**Konstin**, Through the cracks, you can see a gray cement floor. Something gleams on the ground, flickering in the torchlight. It is shaped like a large, wet footprint!"_

**Konstin**: _"Eek! I let the others know."_

**Warden**: _"**Konstin**: You move to notify the others of your discovery, and notice that **Gar** has left the room, but see his torchlight flickering down the **Western** corridor. You meet up with **Leib** just as he digs up the stone fist. You tell him what you've discovered, and point out **Gar's** absence."_

**Konstin**: _"**Gar**, get back here, you dummy!"_

**Warden**: _"**Gar**, The tunnel bends **South** and out of view. The walls are crumbling here, but you can't see much more. Do you continue?"_

**Gar**: _"Yes"_. 

**Warden**: _"You follow the tunnel bend towards the **South-west**. It ends at a closed wooden doorway. It is rotted, it iron lock rusted and coming off the hinges. It would take only a small push to open."_

**Gar**: _"I think I'm going to head back, rather than enter this new area alone."_

**Warden**: _"As you do, you hear a loud banging noise coming from room your friends are in."_

**Warden**: _"Alright folks. You've each completed a full round. Accordingly, **Leib** made a ton of noise_ [**Leib's** player winces], _which means I have to roll on the **Dungeon Events** table!_"

> The **Warden** rolls on the [**Dungeon Events**](#dungeon-events) table. The result is a **1**: an **Encounter**. The **Warden**'s prep indicates that the _Zombies_ in the adjacent room will react to nearby noise, so... 

**Warden**: _"The shuffling sound **Konstin** heard earlier behind the **East** door suddenly becomes much louder. Then, something large and powerful begins **slamming** itself into the wooden door! It creaks and groans under the assault, until finally it explodes from the top! Through the newly-created hole, **Leib** and **Konstin** can clearly make out the face of a decayed human man, his flesh flaking beneath layers of slime. He appears clearly undead, and very, very, angry."_

> **Combat ensues between the party members in the Courtyard - a _turn undead_ spellbook is used, and the player characters are quickly (and brutally) victorious. Gar returns from the tunnel just as the fight is ending.**



## Combat

**Example 1**
Say you have a fighter-type facing off against a bugbear near a riverside cave. In one scenario, she is unprepared, and flails her weapon wildly at the bugbear, using her existing skills and combat training to deal d6 damage with her sword against the bugbear. Combat proceeds as normal, until someone is defeated.

**Example 2**
Now imagine the same fighter, but instead of directly attacking she looks at her surroundings. The player asks, "Is there anything here that would allow me to somehow blind the bugbear, or at least reduce its attack potential? Perhaps some sand?" The Warden rolls on a d6 (Die of Fate) and gets a 4 - this is good news. He tells her that the although ground is pretty flat here, her PC would have noted the pile of dirt not far away from where she is currently standing, just near the river, downhill a bit. She'd need to book it before the bugbear catches up to her (DEX save to leave combat), but on a success she'd have more than enough time to prepare for her attack. 

The player reminds the Warden that her character has an acrobatic background, specifically the circus (this was established long ago as part of her backstory). She argues that her character would likely have some advantage leaping down hills, tumbling, and son on. The Warden agrees that this would be the case, and the PC makes a run for the dirt clod, attempting to leave the bugbear far behind

---
**Example 2a**
The PC makes a DEX save: a fail! "You make a good start of things, but lose your footing about halfway down. You tumble uncomfortably down the hill, taking 1 STR damage in the process. You land face-first in the dirt, but due to your acrobatic nature you are able to glom on to some heaps of muddy earth, just as you hear the creature approach from behind." The bugbear makes a DEX save to avoid, and fails: attacks against it are now enhanced, and its attacks are impaired!

---
**Example 2b**
The PC makes a DEX save: a success! They easily arrive at the base of the hill, with plenty of time to pocket some dirt. So much so that they are able to throw dirt at the creature, and it is unable to save: it is just a bugbear after all - proper planning makes the attempt a piece of cake. The impact is the same as in **2a** but in addition the PC can go first - it has the jump on the creature. Or I might rule that the PC can just deal direct damage in this case.

I've written these examples up to try and illustrate a few things:
- players thinking outside the box
- using your surroundings/fictional positioning, not mechanics to succeed
- using background elements to get "permission" for things to happen, or to modify the consequences (imagine what would have happened had she not been a circus performer?)
- Pressing opportunities through clear advantages
- adjudicating using the die of fate (_is_ there dirt down there?)

This is not to say that GM Fiat isn't a factor. It is - all games of this style are merely GM Fiat. The difference is the procedure for play and how you incorporate elements of the fiction in a clear and consistent way.
If the Warden had rolled a 1 on the Die of Fate, the answer would simply have been NO. And the PC would need to find another option.
