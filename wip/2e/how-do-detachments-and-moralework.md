# How Do Detachments & Morale Work?

> **Wolfram**, **Lucius**, and **Freya** are on the run from a _detachment_ of twelve soldiers [5 HP, 1 Armor, 11 STR, 14 DEX, 12 WIL, short sword (d6), bow (d6)], taking shelter in a burnt out old outpost at the edge of a forest. The soldiers each carry a short sword and bow, except for their leader, a tall man with a bright blue epaulet on his shoulder. The soldiers know that the party have taken refuge in the outpost, and are talking amongst themselves at a safe distance away, just North of where the party is hunkering down. The _detachment_ will be treated as a single entity until they take Critical Damage.

**Warden**: _"The outpost is partly shielded by what remains of its walls, but you must crouch or risk one of the soldiers taking a pot-shot. Through the slats you see the soldiers split off: six head towards the Southwest adjacent the treeline, while the rest (including the tall man) move Southeast, where the walls are the most damaged. It looks like they are planning some kind of pincer attack. Based on their current speed, you have less than a minute to act before they reach the open-side of the shield wall surrounding the outpost, where you'll be sitting ducks! What do you do?"_

**Wolfram**: _"I was in the military, so I know how this goes. That man with the fancy tassel is their leader. If we take him out, the rest might flee. I'm going wait until he is as close as possible, then fire my crossbow at him. If that leaves me exposed, then so be it!"_

**Lucius**: _"You're always so direct, Wolfie! I'm going to pour some of my famous Miracle Oil on the ladder leading up here. That should both prove effective and entertaining!"_

**Freya**: _"And what exactly will stop them from simply firing into our hiding spot from the giant holes on the South side? At the very best, they'll just wait until we run out of food. I have another idea: I'll poke my head through the trapdoor and toss a Smoke Bombs towards each side of the building. That'll give us an advantage for when these other two plans inevitably fail!_

**Lucius**: _"Uh, I guess I'll do that just after she tosses the Smoke Bombs, then?"_

**Warden**: _"That should be fine, yes. But be aware that combat officially breaks out as soon as Lucius stands to fire. And since you're all at the ready, there is no need to make a DEX save: you go first._

**Everyone**: _"Understood."_

> **Player's Turn**

**Warden**: _"The soldiers continue their trajectory, carefully prepared to fire on anyone who approaches. Finally the Leader draws his sword into the air and screams, "Charge! And the soldiers rush towards you. Everything happens at once. Wolfram stands and fires his Crossbow at the leader. Since the leader is part of a detachment, Wolfram can only roll a d4."_

> The result of Wofram's attack is a 3, and as the leader's helmet absorbs 2 point of damage he loses only 1 HP.

**Warden**: _"The arrow whizzes past the leader's shoulder, tearing off his brightly-colored shoulder epaulet. He grimaces and rushes forward towards the East side of the building. Freya, at the same time you pop your head through the trap door and toss a Smoke Bomb on the East and West sides of the building - mark off 2 uses please. Lucius, you stand behind her, and the moment she moves away, you pour some Miracle Oil on the stepladder."_

> **Opponent's Turn **

**Warden**: _As smoke fills either side of the building, you lose sight of the soldiers. It becomes impossible to tell friend from foe, and even the leader disappears in the chaos. A few of the men try to climb the ladder but slide off, landing at the bottom in a heap. Amidst coughing and shouts you hear the leader's voice: 'Burn it to the ground!' Your enemies have essentially lost their turn, but the smoke is starting to dissipate."_

**Wolfram**: _"Damn. Well that bought us some time, at least. Hey Lucius, how flammable is that oil of yours?"_

**Lucius**: _"Very. We may be running out of options._"

**Wolfram**: _"Not quite, dear boy. I'm going to cast Disassemble on my limbs. I want you to throw them at leader. That ought to freak them out!"_

**Lucius and Freya**: _"Both of us???_"

**Wolfram**: _"Yes. Also "_

**Warden**: _"You cast Disassemble, your arms and legs falling into a heap on the floor. Lucius and Freya each pick up two limbs and throw them through the trap door at the leader. The leader isn't in a position to avoid this 'attack' of yours, and he is hit first by one of your arms, then two of your legs, and finally he his struck full in the face by a boot to the face. I am going to make a STR save to see if he is knocked unconscious."_

> The leader rolls a 16 for his STR save, a fail.

**Warden**: _"Yep, that'll do it. He slumps to the ground like a sack of hay. The other soldiers haven't really trained for seeing their leader get taken out by flying limbs, so I'm going to have them make a WIL save using their leaders WIL attribute._" 

> The soldiers make a WIL save using their leader's WIL score (14). They roll a 17, a fail.

**Warden** _"The soldiers pick up their leader and high-tail it back to the edge of the hill among screams and exclamations of 'Sorcery! Witchraft! Help, we're losing limbs right and left over here!' You have an opportunity to flee into the nearby woods now without a DEX save, or across the open fields if you think you can run fast enough. What do you do?"_
