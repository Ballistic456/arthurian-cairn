# Downtime

Between game sessions, players may utilize the following procedures to research a question, follow-up on a lead, improve a skill, or build a relationship. Only one action is possible at a time, and some actions will require multiple steps to complete. These actions may not be taken if the PC is not in a safe space, or while healing/recovering. **Downtime Actions** (including WIL saves) cannot be taken if there is risk of significant _harm_ to a character. Unless otherwise noted, Rations and daily upkeep are not tracked during **Downtime**.

## Milestones

Some **Downtime Actions** require multiple steps to complete. In these cases, the Warden then provides 1-3 **Milestones** that the player can tick off as they progress towards their goal. Most **Milestone** requires a single **Downtime Action** to accomplish, and potentially their own unique **Cost** as well.

- **Milestones** are "zoomed-out" activities that are both abstract and non-interactive.
- The Warden _may_ provide the player with multiple "paths" to accomplishing their goals, each with their own unique **Milestones**. 
- Over time, the **Warden** may add new **Milestones** or remove others entirely, depending on the events of the fiction.  

### Costs

At a minimum, every **Milestone** costs a single **Downtime Action**. If a character cannot pay the **Cost**, they may have to find some other way to achieve their goal. A few examples of **Cost**: 
- **Gold**: Direct payment of gold from a character's inventory.
- **Resources**: Non-monetary costs, such as material goods, specific common items, and so on. 
- **Reputation**: Betting on a character's renown, personality, presence, social connections, etc.
- **Loss**: Offering something specific and unique. A finger, a soul, a **Relic**, etc.   

Some **Costs** can be reduced or disregarded through character skills, connections, or force of will. For example, a PC may have already acquired the necessary reputation to gain access to a renowned institution, and thus the **cost** is abated. On the other hand, another character may not be so lucky, and must rely on their force of personality instead. In this case, the Warden should state the risk (a permanent ban on entry, a loss of reputation, etc.). The PC then makes a **WIL** save; on a success the cost is either reduced or eliminated entirely. 

## Downtime Actions

### Research

A character answers a single question about a bit of lost or forgotten lore, the location of a lost item, the whereabouts of an important NPC, and so on. To take this action the player must have a clearly formulated question they'd like to answer, and a **Source** of knowledge in the game world that their character can interact with. If the PC does not have a **Source**, then they can spend a **Downtime Action** trying to find one. There is no guarantee that they will be successful. Once a question is posed and an appropriate **Source** has been identified, the **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

#### Questions

As always, the question must come from an experience that occured during play. Some example questions:
- "Where is the **Lost Temple of East Nipoor**?" 
- "Who in **Fortune City** might know how to crack an ancient vault?"
- "Where can I find the cure to **curly sickness**?" 

#### Sources

A **Source** is a person, place, faction, or entity that holds either a part or whole answer that the character seeks. They can be NPCs, Factions, spirits, or even other PCs.   Some example of **Sources**:  
- **Kewr the Mouth**, a frequent contact for the **Conclave of Merchants**. Despite their excellent relationship with this faction, asking for help in an illicit activity might come at a high cost.
- A **Woodwose** who makes his home deep in the **Forest of Knives**. The party encountered him in an earlier expedition, and the encounter did not end well. Still, he is said to know the nature of every herb and their healing properties.
- The **Temple of Puppets**, a nomadic circus troupe who have travelled the known and unknown lands. The party assisted one of their members during the **Rain of Fire**, when even the creatures of the Wood were were preparing to flee their homes. If anyone has heard of forgotten places, it's them.

### Training

A character can improve their skills with an item or ability, with clear narrative or mechanical results. They might be interested in dealing greater damage with a particular weapon, decreasing their chances of getting lost in rough weather, or learn to read the languages of the ancients. A PC might spend multiple **Downtime Actions** sparring with a particular weapon, improving their skills week by week. Or they may need to travel to the home of a distant sage, improving themselves through short but intense study.

The player must describe precisely what they'd like to improve, and a **Master** whom they might train with. And of course, the character's inspiration to improve should come from an experience in play. The **Warden** should provide any **Milestones** and associated **Costs**. 

Examples:  
- Blade expertise: When wielding a sword, the damage die is increased from d6 to d8.
- Improved fishing: d6 Rations are gathered when taking the Supply **Action** near healthy sources of water.
- Scholarly wisdom: The texts and signage of ancient temples and cities are finally intelligible, and understanding their Relics far easier.

### Strengthening Ties

Players may choose to foster their character's connection with an NPC or Faction in the game world. First, they must identify the entity with whom they wish to strengthen ties, along with their specific **intent** (e.g., building trust, mending a friendship, seeking membership in a Faction, forming an alliance). The **Warden** then provides concrete measures (described as **Milestones** and **Costs**) that the PC can undertake to advance the relationship. With each completed **Milestone**, the **Warden** describes how the PC's relationship has grown or changed. 

Examples:
- After returning to their home base from an unsuccessful delve into the **Roots**, a PC discovers that they'd unknowingly brought along a stowaway: an eyeless devourer, barely hatched. They decide to keep the creature, and to train it in secret. 
- During a play session, a PC becomes friendly with the **Seneschal** of the **Order of the Helm**. Impressed by the Order's values, the PC asks to join, and what the requirements are.
- An NPC tragically died during the **Battle of Frogs** while under a particular PC's care. Now, the NPC's powerful family is terribly upset, making the PC's adventuring life more difficult. Now, that PC would like to repair their relationship enough so that they can show their face around town once more.
