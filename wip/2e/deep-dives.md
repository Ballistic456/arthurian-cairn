# Deep Dives

## Wilderness Exploration

### Time & Travel Duration

Travel time in Cairn is counted in watches, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third watch of the day resting, one can use "days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to three watches of travel, the party will need to travel for at least one day to arrive at their destination. 

Traveling by maintained road incures no penalties to a journey. Trails and boats adds one watch to the party's total travel duration. To determine the distance between two points, combine the **Path** and **Terrain** type penalties. Traveling through the wilderness always incurs a penalty of _two_ watches. If the party covers multiple types of terrain, only include penalties for the _most difficult_ terrain. 

### Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential points of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points. 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the party's speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

#### Pointcrawl Example

The travel times between each point were determined as follows (assuming that the party is travelling by foot):
- The journey between points **1** to **2** takes 4 watches (two days):  
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains and grasslands.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain.
- The journey between **2** and **4** takes two watches:
  - No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey between **4** and **6** takes one watch due to the maintained road.
- The journey between **4** and **5** takes 3 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
  - Add one watch for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey to **3** from the nearest adjacent points:
  -  +2 for traveling over raw terrain
  -  +2 for traverling through _Tough_ forest terrain.
