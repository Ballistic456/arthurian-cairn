# Deep Dives

## Wilderness Exploration

## Time

Travel time in Cairn is counted in **Watches**, divided into three eight-hour segments per day. However, as most parties elect to spend the third **watch** of the day resting, one can use "days" as a shorthand for travel. For example, if the distance between two points is equal to four **watches** of travel, the party will need to travel for _at least_ two days to arrive at their destintation. 

### Adjusting Travel Speed 

By default, a party can travel a single **watch** between two **points** at _Normal_ travel speed.  _Normal_ travel speed is defined as a short, unmolested journey on foot along a **maintained road**, with fair weather. This rate is _doubled_ for **trails**, and _tripled_ when bushwhacking. Both the terrain and current weather can severly slow down the party's movement, as can caring for an injured party member or travelling with a convoy. Conversely, horses, guides, and local maps can increase the rate of travel. The Warden should weigh all of these factors when determining how much time it takes to travel between one or more **points**. 

## Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential **points** of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each **point**, noting obvious roads and trails. If there are no obvious routes between one or more **points**, denote those as "off-road". 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the **default** travel speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

### Pointcrawl Example

In this example we'll be using a map made with [Watabou's](https://watabou.itch.io/) terrific [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) generator.

A party of 3 PCs (**Leib**, **Konstin**, and **Gar**) are plotting a journey to an ancient ruin deep in the forests of **Ein Eyton**. They plan to walk by foot. 
The forest (at **3**) is separated from the party's present location (the village of **Rudbat**, at **1**) by the neighboring **Range of Deshe** (at **2**), a short distance away. 

The **Warden** explains that travelling on the forgiving roads from the village to the hills will require only a single **watch**, but that it will take three _additional_ **watches** for the party to complete their journey to the forest, assuming they spend one **watch** sleeping. 

The party accepts this route, plotting their route: one **watch** to reach the hills (_morning_), one **watch** partway through the hills (_afternoonh_), then another **watch** sleeping (the **Making Camp** action) at (_night_). The party would spend the following day's _morning_ **watch** travelling to their final destination. On the first day of travel, the **Warden** rolls a 3 on the **Weather** table (**Fall**: _Cool and foggy_). 

For their first **watch**, the party chooses the **Travel** action, taking the road through the farmlands and to the hills. The terrain, weather, and current party status indicates that the **Difficulty** level is **Easy**. The party is able to travel with no forseeable problems, so the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is an **Encounter**. The **Warden** explains that the party crosses paths with an NPC travelling South, who gives them a piece of advice: "_Avoid the hills, there are bandits about_!" The party notes this and moves on, arriving in the **Range of Deshe** after lunchtime. They rest near a streambed, stepping off the dusty road for the first time.

For the party's second **watch**, the **Warden** explains that this area is peppered with small rocks and uneven hills, setting the terrain **Difficulty** to **Tough**. Worse yet, without a guide the party might easily lose their way! The players discuss whether it would be better to spend a **watch** exploring the area, perhaps even finding a faster (and safer) way through. 

The party agrees that arriving at their destination sooner is worth the risk, and proceeds with the **Travel** action again. The players discuss how to avoid **Getting Lost**, checking to see if anyone in the party has knowledge of the area, relevant experience, or a map. They do not, so the **Warden** rolls a d6. The result is not a **1** or a **2**, and the party moves on as planned.

The **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table, and the result is **Environment**. The **Warden** explains that a short while after entering the hills, the ground became much more demanding to cross. Small rocks turned into large crags, the hills to pits and mini-craters. The party now has a choice: push forward, spending a **Fatigue** to keep their current speed, or slow down, adding an additional **watch** of travel to their journey. They agree to push forward, each character adding a **Fatigue** to their inventory. Had they chosen to walk slower it may have been safer, but they would have an additional half-day of walking to do tomorrow.

As night descends, the party finds a large, rocky, outcropping that would work as a suitable shelter. There is no water nearby, but this location should be sufficient for their current needs. They agree to **Make Camp** as their final **watch**, choosing a **Watch Rotation** that should allow all party members a decent rest, and a chance to shed any **Fatigue** they have. Each party member consumes a ration, and the **Warden** rolls on the **Events** table. The result is a **Sign**. The **Warden** describes the flickering ghost of a torchlight in the distance. Could it be another party, or perhaps bandits, or even a dangerous creature on the prowl?

The party rests, erasing their **Fatigue**. They mark their current location on the map, noting that should everything go well the following day, they should only have to spend one **watch** to arrive at the ruins of **Ein Eyton** by the _afternoon_.
