# Dungeon Seeds

## Overview

- Establish a theme
- Find inspiration
- Use examples from real life
- Location
- Setting
- Entrance
- Construction
- History 
- Original Use
- Create the map
- Do it however you can do it
- Be ready to change it- a lot
- Stock the rooms
- [we'll get there]
- Good Keying
- Put everything in maps (dimension, exits)
- Numbering
- Start with what matters most
- Be specific
- Ignore boring stuff
- Only say what's happening _now_
- Don't assume
- Don't tell the PCs how they feel

## Principles

### Purpose

- Demonstrate signs of the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Displays its age and current use.
- Consider was the dungeon was used for, and what is it used for now. 
- What was the dungeon designed to keep out? What was it designed to keep _in_?
  
### Levels

- Levels in a dungeon should represent increased danger as well as thematic intent.
- Each level should push the players to weight the balance of a potential reward vs the risk of continuing on.
  
### Layout
  
- Create multiple entrances and exits. Add meaningful information to doorways to to help players avoid feeling railroaded.
- Offer multiple routes between rooms and incorporate loops, but avoid creating tree-like structures with unnecessary dead ends.
- Design choke points and other tactical opportunities to allow for interesting combat tactics.
- Provide hiding spots for the players to gather information discreetly and allows them to exploit a dungeon's geography.

### Verticality

- Make your rooms tall and create climbable structures.
- Give players things to drop on to/from.
- Make paths that let PCs go up and over, instead of just pushing through.
  
### Secret Areas

- Design hidden zones for players to discover.
- Provide subtle clues that say "something is off here" and "warning: death lies ahead."
- Have at least one place that the players may never find. Make it worth it.
  
### Rooms

- Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
- Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically and provide a hint of what's to come.
- Room descriptions should be easy to map and recall.
  
### Treasure

- Ensure there's always something valuable to seek! That doesn't always mean gold.
- Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
- Add narrative elements, so that some treasure has a greater narrative significance than monetary value.
  
### Challenges

- Emphasize creating opportunities for players to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact.
- Monsters and obstacles are another way to inform the party of the dungeon's story.
- Try to create a sense of peril without making obstacles seem unbeatable.
- Overtly dangerous areas and creatures should be obvious.
- Create combat encounters that can be avoided with critical thinking or problem solving.
    
### NPCs & Factions

- Include NPCs for the players to engage with. These characters should _want_ to stay in the dungeon.
- NPCs (and even monsters) should communicate with the PCs, even during combat. Have them make threats, suggest compromises, or try to persuade the PCs whenever possible.
- Create factions with their own goals and agendas. Everyone wants something, and has a limit to what they might do to get it.
- Factions should interact with one another, as well as the PCs. They should act _regardless_ of what the PCs may do.
- Factions have hierarchies and divisions, both of which the PCs can potentially exploit to their own advantage.

### Describing a Dungeon

- Constantly re-state the party's surroundings, where they are in physical space, and what each character's senses are detecting.
- Don't tell them how they feel. Say, "a long, jagged knife" rather than "an evil-looking knife."
- Always reiterate what is _about_ to happen. Does the flaming barrel look stable, or like it might explode?
- Describe elements to help orient the party to their surroundings. 
  - How close is a PC to a potential danger? Are they above it, or below it?
  - What side of an object is a PC standing in? Are they inside or outside a room, building, or structure?

## Establish a Theme

### Initial Concept

Consider what comes to mind when you think of a dungeon: it might be at the center of an abandoned maze, a trapdoor in a ruined temple, or in a gaping crystal maw in a long-abandoned mine. Consider where the dungeon is located, and how its entrance looks. Keep that image in your mind as we establish the theme. 

> If you have already arrived at a basic concept for your dungeon by way of the Dungeon Types table in [Setting Seeds](/wip/2e/setting-seeds), you may skip ahead to the next section.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it used to be a mill, abandoned after the war took away all the able-bodied workers. Or maybe it was once a great fort, acting as a bulwark against the creatures of the night.

| **20**  | A Dream               | Fungi              |

### Factions

Dungeons (like any other setting) should have one or more Factions with their own unique agenda, obstacles, leaders, and hierarchy.  

#### Agendas

|         |                |              |
| ------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **d20** | **Goal**       | **Obstacle** |
| **1**   | Ascension      | Sacrifice    |
| **2**   | Creation       | Conflict     |
| **3**   | Destruction    | Corruption   |
| **4**   | Dominion       | Cost         |
| **5**   | Enlightenment  | Danger       |
| **6**   | Exploration    | Decay        |
| **7**   | Growth         | Discord      |
| **8**   | Innovation     | Division     |
| **9**   | Justice        | Dogma        |
| **10**  | Knowledge      | Exposure     |
| **11**  | Liberation     | Factionalism |
| **12**  | Peace          | Fear         |
| **13**  | Power          | Ignorance    |
| **14**  | Preservation   | Incompetence |
| **15**  | Protection     | Injustice    |
| **16**  | Redemption     | Isolation    |
| **17**  | Revenge        | Opposition   |
| **18**  | Survival       | Stagnation   |
| **19**  | Transformation | Tradition    |
| **20**  | Wealth         | Weakness     |

### Denizens

Most dungeons will have someone _living_ there. Someone that _prefers_ the dungeon life over any other. These should be NPCs that the party can interact, trade, hire, aid, and so on. These creatures can be deeply involved or entirely neutral towards the dungeon's Factions.

#### Traits

| **20**  | Practical       | Unimaginative |

### Implementation

Let's start with a simple dungeon concept: a former mine, sealed off to prevent further exploration. Perhaps the miners found something they could not contain, and blasted the entry shut? Maybe they even sacrificed some of their own, for "the greater good?"
