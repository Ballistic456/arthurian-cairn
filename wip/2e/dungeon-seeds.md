# Dungeon Seeds

## Principles

- **Purpose**: Consider what the dungeon's original purpose as well as what it being used for today. Demonstrate a dungeon's history by including signs of its original inhabitants and their goals through. Sometimes a dungeon will have multiple purposes, and these can push against each other to create tension among its denizens.
- **Levels**: Levels should represent both increased danger as well as thematic intent. On each level try to push players to weigh the risk of further exploration versus a potential reward.
- **Layout**: Create multiple entrances and exits, offer multiple routes, design choke points, and provide hiding spots. Add meaningful and obvious information to room entrances and exits.
- **Verticality**: Incorporate tall rooms, climbable structures, and paths that allow movement around and over obstacles.
- **Secret Areas**: Include hidden zones, including at least one that will likley reamin undiscovered but is still worth finding. Try to avoid hiding crucial information behind secret rooms.
- **Rooms**: Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions. Use architectural motifs to connect rooms and provide hints of what's to come. Room descriptions should be easy to map and recall.
- **Treasure**: Incorporate a variety of treasures beyond mere gold, such as knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts. Add narrative elements to treasure to increase its non-monetary value.
- **Challenges**: Allow the characters to drive the story by writing challenges without prescribed outcomes. Create a sense of peril, but avoid making obstacles seem unbeatable. Overly dangerous areas and creatures should be obvious. Create encounters that can be avoided with critical thinking or problem-solving, not just violence. Use monsters and other obstacles to help tell the dungeon's story.
- **NPCs**: Include engaging NPCs with their own goals and agendas. These characters may _want_ to stay in the dungeon; they may even love it! NPCs and monsters should communicate with the PCs, even during combat. Have them make threats, suggest compromises, or try to persuade the PCs whenever possible. Every character wants something, and has a limit to what they might do to get it. 
- **Factions**: Factions should interact with both the characters and one another, acting on their own regardless of the character's actions. Give them hierarchies and divisions that can be exploited. 
- **Puzzles**: Create puzzles that have clear, actionable goals. Puzzles should reinforce the themes of the dungeon and build on its history. Make the challenge of the puzzle obvious, but the solution less so. Allow for multiple solutions, and for players to solve them using intelligence and critical thinking, not just special abilities or tools. Create built-in clues suggesting the puzzle's origin and its effects. 
- **The Dungeon Map**: Put boring or repetitive stuff (exits, room shapes, etc.) on the map. Obvious exits should be described using clear, distinct language. Number your rooms to help avoid confusion when referencing the map.
- **Room Keying**: Emphasize a room's most important aspects (typically obvious threats or NPCs). Describe elements that help orient the party to their surroundings. Be specific, but avoid describing how the characters should _feel_. Only describe what's happening _now_. If there is history here, the characters will discover it in play. Name each room!
- **Describing a Dungeon**: Always reiterate what is _about_ to happen. Does that flaming barrel look stable, or like it might explode? Constantly re-state a character's surroundings, where they are in physical space, and what their senses are detecting. Provide hints about what lies beyond the next corridor, including odors, sounds, and elevation.

## Creating a Dungeon

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **dungeon map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

Follow this procedure for any Dungeon POIs in your setting. Refer to the dungeon type table results from earlier, reading the results from your map. What image springs immediately to mind? Where is the dungeon is located? What does its entrance look like? Don't worry if you can't answer these questions yet. By the end of this process, you should be able to.

### Overview

- Describe the dungeon's original purpose, its construction, and finally its ruination.
- Describe the dungeon's NPCs and Factions, including their unique traits and agendas.
- Finalize the dungeon theme.
- Create the dungeon's rooms.
- Create an encounter table.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it was once a great forge, capable of building the world's most powerful weapon. Or maybe it was once a burial site for ancient kings, binding their souls to the lands they once ruled. Roll on the tables below, noting the results in your notebook, keeping the following questions in mind: 

_"What kind of dungeon is this, and what makes it unusual?"_

_"Why was this dungeon built, how was it built, and what caused its downfall?"_

### Denizens

Most dungeons will have creatures that _live_ there, and make it their home. The following table can be used to describe the general attitude of any or all of the intelligent creatures in the dungeon. Roll on the Traits table, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the dungeon.

Meanwhile, every dungeon should have at least one NPC that stands out from all the others. These types _prefer_ the dungeon life over any other, but still act differently than their brethren. They should be NPCs that the party can interact, trade, hire, aid, and so on. These strange creatures can be deeply involved or entirely neutral towards the dungeon's other denizens and Factions.  Roll on the Traits table again, writing the results in your notebook, keeping the following questions in mind: 

_"What do we know about the creatures and Factions that occupy the dungeon?"_

_"What are each Factions trying to achieve, and what stands in their way?"_

### Encounter Tables

[Build encounter tables.]

## Create the Map

- Roll **6-20 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the dungeon's _rooms_.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Dungeon Die Drop Table](#dungeon-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Special** room, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- If a room feels "too far" from the rest, roll another die and follow the previous process to add a new room.
- Select the room closest to the page border. This is the _entrance_ to the dungeon.
- Starting with the entrance, number each room on the dungeon map.

#### Dungeon Die Drop Table

|         |          |
| ------- | -------- |
| **d6**  | **Room** |
| **1-2** | Lore     |
| **3-4** | Monster  |
| **4**   | Special  |
| **5-6** | Trap     |

### Draw Paths

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 paths between each room. 
 - Create loops, branching hallways, dead-ends, and shortcuts between rooms.
 - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create at least two intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.

### Stock the Rooms

- Roll on the relevant tables for each room, writing the results in your notebook. 
- For each room, filter the table results through the theme you generated earlier in this process. 

#### Lore

Lore rooms should build on the theme of the dungeon, provide a valuable lesson, or connect the characters with an NPC or Faction. They might create a dilemma or moral conflict that unites the party, or puts them at odds with their mission. These rooms help re-contextualize the dungeon and its overarching themes, twisting the party's perspective a bit. At the minimum these rooms act as a curiosity, adding something memorable to the dungeon delving experience beyond simple danger and puzzle-solving. Of course, the characters never know that these rooms do not contain monsters, puzzles, or other challenges. This helps increase tension in the dungeon, while offering a potential respite and opportunity for growing the narrative.

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature that lives in a dungeon. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not simply "waiting around" for the characters to find them, but instead have their own wants and goals, even if they are simply looking for their next meal. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

# Special

Special rooms areas are uncommon areas that feature a hidden or interactive element. This element can be a challenge, an obstacle, a puzzle, or all of the above. These rooms should offer difficult choices with long-term impacts. They might make dungeon exploration easier, but with a serious cost.

## Dungeon Example

For this example, let's assume we are looking at a POI generated using the methods described in the Setting Seeds chapter. Our relevant results were:

- **Terrain**: _Forest_
- **Type**: _Temple_
- **Feature**: _Isolated_

### What kind of dungeon is this, and what makes it unusual?

_A remote forest temple, cut off from the world by a vast ocean of trees and shrubbery._

We then roll on the **Purpose**, **Construction**, and **Ruination** tables and get the following results:

- **Purpose**: The _Protection of rare artifacts_. Built by a _fanatical cult_. 
- **Construction**: The entrance is _between a circle of menhirs_, and its foundation is built of the very same _petrified wood_ that surrounds it.
- **Ruination**: _Divided_ (literally) by _competing rituals_.

### Why was this dungeon built and what caused its downfall?

_It was designed by an extremist cult of forest druids to house reality-altering Relic. Its entrance is beneath a false stone in a circle of menhirs deep in the forest. The walls and ceiling of the dungeon are built from petrified wood, as the ancient artifact affects living plants, warping them to its will. A division within the cult faced off over control of the Relic, but fell victim to their own hubris and nearly destroyed one another. When two opposing rituals collided, the temple was split in two, divided along Factional lines. The Relic was lost in the aftermath._

Continuing on to the current inhabitants of our dungeon, we get the following results (rolling for _two_ factions):

- **Denizens**: The creatures living here are _practical,_ yet _unimaginative_.
- **Faction A**: Goal: _Destruction_. Obstacle: _Opposition_.
- **Faction B**: Goal: _Redemption_. Obstacle: _Tradition_.

### What do we know about the creatures and Factions that occupy the dungeon?

_The current denizens of this dungeon are the descendants of the original Factions, are typically pragmatic about their ceaseless war, and cannot imagine a way out._

### What are each Factions trying to achieve, and what stands in their way?

**The Crimson Path** would like to destroy their former brethren the **Azure Legion**, but are cowed by their opponent's prowess in battle. The Azure Legion feel great shame over the actions of their forebears, and believe that their redemption can only be achieved by way of finding and destroying the temple's hidden artifact. Unfortunately an ancient custom decrees that no one wearing the Azure cloth may seek the lost Relic.

### Dungeon Theme

With some idea on the history, purpose, and denizens of the dungeon, we finally have our theme. Let's put it all together:

_Nestled within a dense, shrouded forest lies a temple made entirely of petrified wood. Built by a fanatical cult to protect an ancient Relic, its entrance is concealed by a false menhirs. Eventually the cult became divided, splitting into two opposed Factions. When their dueling rituals collided the temple was shattered, with each Faction taking one half. Today the descendants of these factions still vie for control, destruction and redemption, but are hindered by power imbalances and ancient tradition._

_The Crimson Path believe that if the original Relic were recovered, they might bend its power to destroy their the Azure Legion forever. However every attempt to plumb the temple's depths has been countered by their former brethren. A recent attack has left many of their number dead, and the remaining members have since fled the temple to regroup._

_The Azure Legion feel a great sense of shame over their ancestor's actions believe that if the original Relic were destroyed, the temple would be healed again and their shame expunged. Unfortunately, a long-standing tradition prohibits any members from seeking the Relic, so as to avoid the mistakes of the past._

_In the center of the temple (between **3** and **4**) a massive crack (the Fracture) splits the dungeon in two, and acts as a sort of demilitarized zone. Both Factions realize that only death lies across its threshold._

_Hidden deep within the dungeon is a Relic called the **Woodturn**. It is capable of petrifying trees, wood, or other plant life through mere contact. If not properly contained it could turn an entire forest into a wasteland!_

#### Hooks

- The Crimson Path has made a public offer of 300gp apiece for the safe retrieval of an "ancient relic" deep within the temple. The party may find some respite among the Red Robes, but otherwise the characters will be on their own in dealing with any "opposition." 
- The party is contacted by an agent of the Azure Legion, acting in secret. The party is to find and destroy the **Woodturn**, an item of great power lost somewhere in the temple. The mission is to remain a secret, and any Factions of Red _or_ Blue will likely stand against them. The characters are to be paid 1000gp (total) for evidence of the Relic's destruction.

### Map

### Entrance: Circle of Menhirs

A small circle of 10' tall **stones** are set in a circle atop a **grassy** hill. White **trees** surround the glade on all sides.

- **Grass**: A patch in the center is browner than the rest.
  - A trap door is concealed underneath. Petrified wooden steps lead down to **1**.
- **Stones**: Moss-covered, with thin, ruined writing in an ancient script.
  - An expert in such matters can still determine that the stones are many centuries old.
- **Trees**: Petrified, and as white as stone.

### 1 - Dining Hall

**Lore**: _Dining Hall_. _Smell_.

Long, rustic **tables** are arranged in horizontal rows. The **smell** of root vegetables and cloves lingers in the air.

- **Tables**: Large enough for 80 people, used by the cult before the split. 
- **Smell**: Strongest near the North passage (towards **4**).

### 2 - Sitting Room

**Special**: _Furniture_. _Falls_.

Plush, **dust-covered** chairs and couches are arranged in a semi-circle around a black, wooden **chair**. The air in the room tastes stale.

- **Dust**: Most of the furniture appears long-abandoned, but the black chair is dust-free.
- **Chair**: Clean and shiny, as if new. Ankle straps are tied to the underside of the chair, which is bolted to the floor.
  - A thin, nearly-invisible square line is cut around the chair.
  - Sitting in the chair and attaching the straps causes the floor beneath the chair to lower, descending to **3**.

### 3 - Basilisk Lair

**Monster**: _Lizard_. _Recuperating_.

A Basilisk sleeps on a nest built atop a slab of **wall** on the East side of the room. In the center of the room is a tall glass **cage** runs from the floor to the **ceiling**. A long, broken **chain** is attached to the South wall.

- **Basilisk**: Recuperating after having just birthed a new clutch of three new eggs.
  - She warms her eggs by sitting atop them, and will not leave them for very long. 
  - The eggs are worth 1000gp each. They _bulky_ and extremely fragile.
- **Wall**: The passage East is still accessible, despite having collapsed. The Basilisk is too large to traverse the rubble.
- **Cage**: Acts as an observation chute from **2**, where new acolytes were lowered into the chamber and forced to encounter the Basilisk.
- **Chain**: Once used to trap the Basilisk here.

### Basilisk

10 HP, 1 Armor, 12 STR, 13 DEX, 13 WIL, bite (d10)

- Long, serpentine lizards that nest deep below the earth or in brambles just underfoot. 
- Fighting a **Basilisk** without meeting its gaze is difficult (attacks facing it are _impaired_).
- **Gaze**: A target facing the Basilisk is slowly petrified, from the bottom up, completely frozen after three rounds. An antidote can be brewed from the Basilisk's gizzards. The creature's reflection is harmless.

### 4 - Kitchen

**Trap**: _Poisons_. _Stepping_.

The withered **corpse** of a man is stretched atop a large butcher block. A **sconce** on the West wall burns twin blue flames over the West exit. Open **cupboards** stand at knee-height on the North wall.

- **Corpse**: Dressed in the Red Robes of the Crimson Path. Looks at least two weeks dead.
  - There are no obvious wounds or markings, save for a green crust around the man's lip.
  - He carries a white dagger made of petrified wood (d8).
- **Sconce**: Passing beneath the flames releases a poison gas spray into the room, dealing d4 STR damage to anyone nearby (save to avoid losing consciousness).
- **Cupboards**: Bare. The arrangement of the cupboards and the block seem to imply that this room was once a communal kitchen. 
  - One of the cupboards has a false back that can be depressed, disabling the poison gas trap for one minute.

### 5 - Study

**Lore**: _Study_. _Decor_.

Bookshelves wrap around every inch of wall, heaps of **books** stacked on dusty **shelves**. An unlit **candelabra** hangs from the ceiling.

- **Books**: Untouched for decades. Clearing the dust from the spines reveal all manner of subjects.
  - Nearly every word in every book has been blacked out in stark black.
- **Shelves**: Despite the lack of furniture, the room looks like it may have been a well-used study at one time.
- **Candelabra**: Unusual design, worth 500gp (four slots, brittle). 
  - The candles (5 uses) are still accessible (assuming they can be reached). When lit, they produce around 20ft of darkness that is impenetrable my non-magical light. They were placed here as a final insult against the old study.

### 6 - The Fractured Hall

**Special**: _Smoke_. _Illusion_.

Swirling **smoke** fills the air in a ceaseless typhoon of ash and embers, obscuring the exits. Faint **movement** is visible through the smoke, as well as occasional shouting from the West side of the room. The **floor** is not level, with the East side raised a full foot higher than the West.

- **Smoke**: Magical, it emits no sound or smell. The exits in this room are obscured.
  - The doorway near the SW corridor contains the broken statue of a robed figure (see Basilisk, **3**).
- **Movement**: Robed soldiers engaged in melee combat with unseen opponents.
  - There are always at least 3 members of either Faction engaged in skirmishes here. They will generally attack any shapes that try to cross the room but are easily confused by the smoke.
  - Due to the smoke all attacks are _impaired_ and it is impossible to determine friend from foe.
- **Floor**: Split when the temple fractured. Along with the smoke, navigation in this room is extremely difficult.

#### Druid Cultist 

5 HP, 11 STR, 12 DEX, 8 WIL, petrified short sword (d8)

- Wears a Red or Blue robe to indicate their factional allegiance. Are otherwise indistinguishable.

### 7 - 

**Trap**: _Confuses_. _Interacting_.

### 8 - 

**Monster**: _Insectoid_. _Hiding_.

A _Burrowing Horror_, hiding in wait beneath ___.

### 9 - 

**Special**: _Mirror_. _Locks_.

The outline of a white **circle** is burnt into the ground in the center of the room.

- **Circle**: A remnant of the Faction's colliding rituals. It is mostly inert.
  - Stepping within the circle triggers a vision of a black, seed-shaped object being used to petrify a tree by a man wearing blue and red robes.

- **Woodturn**:
