## Overview

- Establish a theme
- Find inspiration
- Use examples from real life
- Location
- Setting
- Entrance
- Construction
- History 
- Original Use
- Create the map
- Do it however you can do it
- Be ready to change it- a lot
- Stock the rooms
- [we'll get there]
- Good Keying
- Put everything in maps (dimension, exits)
- Numbering
- Start with what matters most
- Be specific
- Ignore boring stuff
- Only say what's happening _now_
- Don't assume
- Don't tell the PCs how they feel

## Principles

### Purpose

- Demonstrate signs of the original inhabitants, design, or goal of the dungeon. Displays its age and current use.
- Consider was the dungeon was used for, and what is it used for now. 
- What was the dungeon designed to keep out? What was it designed to keep _in_?
  
### Levels

- Levels in a dungeon should represent increased danger as well as thematic intent.
- Each level should push the players to weight the balance of a potential reward vs the risk of continuing on.
  
### Layout
  
- Create multiple entrances and exits. Add meaningful information to doorways to to help players avoid feeling railroaded.
- Offer multiple routes between rooms and incorporate loops, but avoid creating tree-like structures with unnecessary dead ends.
- Design choke points and other tactical opportunities to allow for interesting combat tactics.
- Provide hiding spots for the players to gather information discreetly and allows them to exploit a dungeon's geography.

### Verticality

- Make your rooms tall and create climbable structures.
- Give players things to drop on to/from.
- Make paths that let PCs go up and over, instead of just pushing through.
  
### Secret Areas

- Design hidden zones for players to discover.
- Provide subtle clues that say "something is off here" and "warning: death lies ahead."
- Have at least one place that the players may never find. Make it worth it.
  
### Rooms

- Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
- Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically and provide a hint of what's to come.
- Room descriptions should be easy to map and recall.
  
### Treasure

- Ensure there's always something valuable to seek! That doesn't always mean gold.
- Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
- Add narrative elements, so that some treasure has a greater narrative significance than monetary value.
  
### Challenges

- Emphasize creating opportunities for players to make their own decisions, so that their choices have the greatest possible impact.
- Monsters and obstacles are another way to inform the party of the dungeon's story.
- Try to create a sense of peril without making obstacles seem unbeatable.
- Overtly dangerous areas and creatures should be obvious.
- Create combat encounters that can be avoided with critical thinking or problem solving.
    
### NPCs & Factions

- Include NPCs for the players to engage with. These characters should _want_ to stay in the dungeon.
- NPCs (and even monsters) should communicate with the PCs, even during combat. Have them make threats, suggest compromises, or try to persuade the PCs whenever possible.
- Create factions with their own goals and agendas. Everyone wants something, and has a limit to what they might do to get it.
- Factions should interact with one another, as well as the PCs. They should act _regardless_ of what the PCs may do.
- Factions have hierarchies and divisions, both of which the PCs can potentially exploit to their own advantage.

### Describing a Dungeon

- Constantly re-state the party's surroundings, where they are in physical space, and what each character's senses are detecting.
- Don't tell them how they feel. Say, "a long, jagged knife" rather than "an evil-looking knife."
- Always reiterate what is _about_ to happen. Does the flaming barrel look stable, or like it might explode?
- Describe elements to help orient the party to their surroundings. 
 - How close is a PC to a potential danger? Are they above it, or below it?
 - What side of an object is a PC standing in? Are they inside or outside a room, building, or structure?

## Creating a Dungeon

Follow this procedure for any Dungeon POIs in your setting. Refer to the dungeon type table results from earlier, reading the results from your map. What image springs immediately to mind? Where is the dungeon is located? What does its entrance look like? Don't worry if you can't answer these questions yet. By the end of this process, you should be able to.

### History

Who built the dungeon? What was its originally used for? Perhaps it was once a great forge, capable of building the world's most powerful weapon. Or maybe it was once a burial site for ancient kings, binding their souls to the lands they once ruled.

### Denizens

Most dungeons will have people and creatures _living_ there. These types _prefer_ the dungeon life over any other. They should be NPCs that the party can interact, trade, hire, aid, and so on. These creatures can be deeply involved or entirely neutral towards the dungeon's Factions.

### Implementation

Let's assume that our earlier POI result was:
- **Type**: _Shrouded Grove_
- **Feature**: _Petrified Wood_

We can easily imagine that this dungeon can be found in a dark, impenetrable forest with very little light, and at its center a small copse of petrified trees. It is likely hidden from view, and known by very few outside the forest boundary. 

Continuing to roll on the **Purpose**, **Construction**, and **Ruination** tables we get the following results:

- **Purpose**: Originally constructed to _protect of rare artifacts_. Built by a _fanatical cult_. 
- **Construction**: The entrance is _between a circle of menhirs_, and its foundation is built of the very same _petrified wood_ that surrounds it.
- **Ruination**: _Sealed_ as a result of _competing rituals_.

We can picture it now: a forest temple built of petrified wood, designed to house rare and powerful Relics by an extremist sect of druids. After a magical accident sealed the doors forever shut, it can now only be entered through a circle of ancient menhirs. Who caused the incident that led to the temple's ruin? Perhaps a schism divided the cult, both sides vying for power through ritual domination.
