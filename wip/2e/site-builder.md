# Site Builder

## Overview

The following procedure should provide a means for the Warden to create a game setting bit by bit, region by region, adventure site by adventure site. First we'll define the realm's terrain and theme, then we'll divide up the map into regions, and finally we'll stock each region with interesting things for the player characters to do.

## The Realm

The unique combination of terrain, political boundaries, and people in a particular place is called a **Realm**. This term can also refer to the overall "theme" of your setting, as well as the sorts of adventures the player characters will get up to.

### Materials Required

- At least one sheet of paper. Letter/A4 is OK, but the larger the better.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

### Topography

Roll on the [Terrain](#terrain) table below to determine the dominant terrain, as well as one interesting feature common to the realm. This terrain will be the "default" terrain of your realm.

> As with any other table, if you don't like the result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### People

The most important aspect of a realm are its _people_: their character, ambitions, and the resources that tie them to this land. Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables, then answer the following:
- How do the people that live here perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
- How does the Realm's dominant terrain effect the people that live here? 
- What would draw people here? What would keep them here?

> Feel free to roll on each table multiple times. If there are

### Factions

A Realm is dominated by one or more Factions, each with its own unique advantages, goals, and obstacles. Roll 1-4 times on [Faction Types](#faction-types), [Faction Agendas](#faction-agendas) and [Seneschals](#seneschals) tables, then answer the following for each:
- What power do they have over the people who live here?
- Who or what threatens their Agenda?
- How would the Faction interact with any newcomers (i.e. an adventuring party)?

### Regions

A realm is made up of a dozen or more regions, defined by changes in terrain, a seat of power, unusual points of interest, or a unique landmark. 

- To create regions, roll 6d6 on your sheet of paper, collecting any dice that roll off the page. 
- Note the face up results according to the [Die Drop Table](#die-drop-table), writing its corresponding letter on the page beneath (e.g. W = Waypoint, D = Dungeon, etc.). These are the maps's Points of Interest (POIs).
- Roll any dice that fell off the page, repeating the previous process until there are no dice remaining.
- Draw a line around each POI, carving the map into at least 6 segments. Each segment represents a region.

### Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlements**: Permanent, largely self-sufficient population centers, typically governed by a political body or faction.
- **Waypoints**: A safe place to refill supplies, get a good night's sleep, or get directions. Often rely on travelers for survival, but provide necessary services.
- **Curiosities**: A wilderness locale of note, somewhere remarkable or strange. It may indeed be hazardous, but only if the PCs interact with it.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

> Some POIs may allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.
