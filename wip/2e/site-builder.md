# Site Builder

## Prospectus

I'd like to build a procedure wherein the Warden can create a world bit by bit, using region by region, adventure site by adventure site. First we'll define the realm's overall terrain and themes, then we'll "zoom in" to a particular chunk (a "region") and build from there. I'm looking at terms like "realm" or "domain" or "principality" for the larger context.

## The Realm

The unique combination of terrain, political boundaries, and people in a particular place is called a **Realm**. This term can also refer to the overall "theme" of your setting, as well as the sorts of adventures the player characters will get up to.

### Geography

Roll on the [Terrain](#terrain) table below to determine the dominant terrain, as well as one interesting feature common to the realm. This terrain will be the "default" terrain of your realm.

> As with any other table, if you don't like the result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### People

The most important aspect of a realm are its _people_: their character, ambitions, and the resources that tie them to this land. Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables, then answer the following:
- How do the people that live here perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
- How does the Realm's dominant terrain effect the people that live here? 
- What would draw people here? What would keep them here?

> Feel free to roll on each table multiple times. If there are

### Factions

A Realm is dominated by one or more Factions, each with its own unique advantages, goals, and obstacles. Roll 1-4 times on [Faction Types](#faction-types), [Faction Agendas](#faction-agendas) and [Seneschals](#seneschals) tables, then answer the following for each:
- What power do they have over the people who live here?
- Who or what threatens their Agenda?
- How would the Faction interact with any newcomers (i.e. an adventuring party)?
- What sorts of people act on behalf of these Factions?
