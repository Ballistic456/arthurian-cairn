# Site Builder

## Prospectus

I'd like to build a procedure wherein the Warden can create a world bit by bit, using region by region, adventure site by adventure site. First we'll define the realm's overall terrain and themes, then we'll "zoom in" to a particular chunk ("region") and build from there.

## Theme

### People

The most important aspect of a setting are its _people_. But they are shaped by the terrain and history of their region, which is why we generate their character, ambitions, and resources at the very end. 

- Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables for every region that has a settlement. and record the results. Then answer the following:
  - How do the people that live there perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
  - What effects does the region's terrain have on the people that live there? 
  - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce? 
  - What would draw someone there, and why would they stay? 

### Culture

Roll 2d20 and combine the results.
