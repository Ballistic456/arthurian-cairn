# Setting Seeds

## Overview

The following procedure is designed to help create the _seed_ of a setting: the paths, places, and geography that an adventuring party may have to navigate as they travel throughout a region. We'll start by first creating the region's theme, by determining its topography, natural features, people, and resources. Then we'll build the initial paths and locales at the focal point of the setting, and finish by repeating the process a few more times to flesh out the region a bit more.

## Create a Theme

- Roll on the [Topography](#topography) table and record the results.
  - What effects does the region's terrain have on the people that live there? 
  - What would draw someone there, and why would they stay? 
- Roll on the [People](#people) table and record the result.
  - How do the people that live there perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
- Roll on the [Resources](#resources) table and record the results.
   - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce? 
   - How do these factors relate to the other aspects of the region, and how does it shape the people that live there?

Once you've gathered the results of these tables, combine them in order to create a cohesive theme for this region. For example, if I rolled a region covered in plains and surrounded by rivers, I might assume that the locals here were tradespeople, selling their wares to the neighbors downriver. If I rolled that the people there were religious and sought conversion, I'd assume they were a proud folk, but prone to religious extremes and proselytizing. And if their primary resources were land, I'd assume they grew their own food, but that their traders were always on the search for spices from distant lands.

## Create the Map

- Roll 6d6 on a sheet of paper.
 - Circle 2-3 "clumps" of dice. These are the map's regions. 
   - Roll on the [Regions](#regions) table for each clump and note the results.
   - Regions are wide swaths of land defined by a particular terrain (e.g. tundra, hills, etc.), arbitrary political boundaries (a kingdom, a barony, etc.), or both.
   - Circle each individual die, writing the face-up die result on the map beneath.
- Compare each individual die result to the [Die Drop](#die-drop-table) table and note the results.
   - Roll 2d20 on the relevant tables and combine for each POI.
- Roll 1d6. This is the region's Heart, or primary settlement. Ignore the die face and roll on the [Settlement](#settlement) table.
- Create 1-4 paths between each location.
  - Mark the distance between each POI by rolling 1d6 for close POIs, 2d6 for moderate distances, and 3d6 for POIs far apart. The result is how many days of travel between each point.

> Note: The **Heart** is always a **Settlement** of some kind. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history

### Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlements**: Any civilized community larger than a single family or religious order. Typically a village, town, or city. 
- **Refuges**: A safe, populated haven. An inn, monastery, sanctuary, prison, campground, etc.
- **Special**: A locale that is unlikely to be directly dangerous, but definitely remarkable or strange.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

### Paths

- **Standard**: A path typical to the region, lacking in special features.
- **Barrier**: A geographic obstruction that slows down or completely blocks further travel. Examples can include rivers, changes in elevation, thickly-grown trees, sinkholes, and more. 
- **Chain**: The path is a segment in a series, typically tied to terrain (mountain passes, rivers, trade routes, etc.).
- **Dead End**: Leads to a remote or isolated location.
- **Encounter**: The risk of peril is increased. Roll on the Wilderness Event table an extra time, and the chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Hidden**: A path not appearing on any known maps. Learning about them always require some kind of cost. Additionally, chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Shortcut**: A path that provides a significant boost in speed to another POI.

#### Draw Paths

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a five-pointed star. This is the "Heart" of your adventure site. 
- Select a point on the star, and roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table and draw the results.
  - Assume that all paths are one Watch long. If you'd like to make them longer, make sure to place more POIs along the way! 
  - Don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, at this time. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and other details (towns, Ruins, etc.).
  - Create between 3-5 paths from each of the star's points.
- Next, determine whether the path is going to be a Trail (T), a Road (R), or a Wilderness (W) route.

> Some paths may lead to POIs that allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.
