# Setting Seeds

## Overview

1. Create the region's topography, people, resources, and heart.
2. Extend via paths and new POIs.
3. Terminate via borders.

## Create the Overarching Theme

 - Create the region's major terrain and topographic features.
 - Create the defining aspects of the people living their, as well as their ambitions.
 - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce?
 - What makes up the heart of this region, and what problems to they have?

### The Heart

The **Heart** is always a **Refuge** of some kind, a place of relative calm and safety. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history. Roll 2d20 and combine the results.

## The Map

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into three categories:  
- **Refuge**: A town, temple, or place of shelter.
- **Landmarks** or **Hazard**: A significant geographic signpost or hazard.
- **Lairs** or **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous adventure site.

### Paths

Some paths may lead to POIs that allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

- **Barrier**: A change in the biome's terrain that slows down or completely blocks further travel. Examples can include rivers, changes in elevation, thickly-grown trees, sinkholes, and more. 
- **Chain**: The path is a segment in a series, typically tied to terrain (mountain passes, rivers, trade routes, etc.).
- **Dead End**: Leads to a remote or isolated location.
- **Encounter**: The risk of peril is increased. Roll on the Wilderness Event table an extra time, and the chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Hidden**: A path not appearing on any known maps. Learning about them always require some kind of cost. Additionally, chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Shortcut**: A path that provides a significant boost in speed to an existing POI.

### The Basics

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a circle. This is the Heart of your adventure site. 
- Roll 4d12 and write the results around the circle as if it were a clock face. Ignore any duplicates. 
- Roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table and draw the result, starting with the earliest time on the clock. 
  - Denote the path type as R (road), T (trail) and W (wilderness), as well as its individual features according to the [Legend](#legend) below.
- At the terminus of each line, add a Point of Interest (POI):
  - A circle indicating a _refuge_ (a town, a city, a farm, etc).
  - A triangle indicating a _landmark_ or _hazard_ (a rock formation, a stone bridge, a sinkhole, etc.).
  - A diamond indicating a _dungeon_ or _lair_ (a cave, a burrow, a crypt, etc.).
- From each POI, roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table again and draw the results.
- [Roll on the appropriate table for each POI]
- Number each POI, starting with the Heart.

> We can assume that all paths are one Watch long for this procedure, but if you'd like to make them longer, make sure to place more POIs along the way! Also, don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, at this time. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and other details (towns, dungeons, etc.).

| **3**  | Alpine    | Caverns canyons , cliffs, tundra    |


**Montane**: Starts where the forest line ends and extends up to the tree line, and is mostly forests and meadows.
**Subalpine**: Just below the alpine zone, characterized by harsher conditions than the montane and often features shrubland, meadows, and sparse forests.
**Alpine**: Above the tree line, this zone includes areas where trees cannot grow, featuring mostly grasslands, rocky terrain, and snowfields.
