# Setting Seeds

## Introduction

Points on a map are generally divided into three categories:

- **Refuge**: A town, temple, or place of shelter.
- **Landmarks** or **Hazard**: A significant geographic signpost or hazard.
- **Lairs** or **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous adventure site.

## Overview

1. Create the region's topography, people, resources, and heart.
2. Extend via paths and new POIs.
3. Terminate via borders.

## Create the Overarching Theme

 - Create the region's terrain and topographic features.
 - Create the civilization's defining aspects, as well as their ambitions.
 - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce?
 - What makes up the heart of this region, and what problems to they have?

### The Heart

The **Heart** is always a **Refuge** of some kind, a place of relative calm and safety. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history. Roll 2d20 and combine the results.

## The Map

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a circle. This is the Heart of your adventure site. 
- Roll 1d4 and write the resulting numbers around the Heart as if it were a clock face. 
- Starting with the lowest number, draw any combination of the following Paths:
  - A bold line indicating an accessible Path.
  - A dashed line indicating a _hidden_ Path.
  - A line with an X over it indicating a _blocked_ Path.
  - A line with a number on top (1-4) indicating _elevation_.
- At the terminus of each line, add a Point of Interest (POI):
  - A circle to represent a _refuge_ (town, city, farm, etc).
  - A triangle to represent a _landmark or hazard_ (rock formation, stone bridge, sinkhole, etc.).
  - A diamond to represent a _dungeon or lair_ (cave, burrow, crypt, etc.).
- From each POI add a new Path, terminating in a new POI _or_ connecting to an existing POI.
- Number each POI, starting with the Heart.

> At this time, don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, as those will be decided later. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and refuge details.

### Paths
 
 - Starting from the Heart, select a Path. 
   - If it is _accessible_, roll 2d6 on the [Accessible Paths](#accessible-paths) table.
   - If it is _hidden_, roll 2d6 on the [Hidden Paths](#hidden-paths) table or choose appropriate option.
   - If it is _blocked_ roll 2d6 on the [Blocked Paths](#blocked-paths) table or choose an appropriate option.
   - If it is at a different _elevation_, roll 2d4 on the [Elevated Paths](#elevated-paths) table or choose an appropriate option.
 - Continue this process until all of the Paths on the map have been created.

### More examples

- A vast tundra of glaciers, ice caves, and beasts long forgotten. Small settlements dot the frozen landscape, competing for food, warmth, and mates. A newly-appointed clan chief is uniting formerly warring tribes, building an army greater than any seen before. Now, their forces are digging into the Star Ridge mountains, searching the icy rivers for something - or someone -long-thought lost to time.
- Within a manufactured dome of alien technology, people live in relative harmony, united by the Benefactor, an immortal entity of powerful knowledge and perception. Crime is nearly obselete, as the Benefactor arrests its perpetrators before even their own intentions are known to themselves. There are those who say this system is unfair, organizing in secret to overthrow their perfect leader. Or so they think...
- Seven warring kingdoms jostle for a single landmass in an endless war. The greatest of these nations were corrupted from within, destroying a thousand-year old regime in a matter of months. Now their former enemies comb the lands of this once glorious nation, searching its bloated corpse for whatever riches may remain, all the while wondering who will be next?
- An archipelago boasting thousands of small islands, their biomes equally as diverse as their animals and plant life. Rival factions ride the crimson seas in search of a holy artifact that is prophesized to unite not only the broken clans, but the earth itself. 
- A post-apocalyptic wasteland littered with ancient technology, derelict sky-ships, and ruled by the Time Wizards. Cracked deserts and spiral forests encroach the last megacity, the only true respite from their cruelty.
