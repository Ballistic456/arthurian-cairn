# Setting Seeds

## Overview

The following procedure is designed to help create the _seed_ of a setting: the unique topography, natural features, people, and paths that an adventuring party may have to navigate as they travel throughout a region. We'll start by develop the people that live their, their ambitions and resources, and the factions that rule them. Then we'll generate the terrain of your region, followed by its various points of interest, landmarks, roads, trails, and so on.

## Example

Before you begin please check out this example (click on it):

## The Realm

A **Realm** is a general term for a related collection of regions, potentially encompassing hundreds of places for the player characters to visit and interact with. Each region is defined by its terrain, as well as the culture of its people, their ambitions, their resources, and the Factions that rule them.

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is OK, but the larger the better.
- Pencils and erasers. Color pencils if you want to make it pretty, or want to designate terrain with color.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

## Theme

### People

The most important aspect of a region are its _people_: their character, ambitions, and the resources that tie them to this land. Roll on the [Culture](#culture) and [Resources](#resources) tables, then note the results in your notebook.    

#### Culture

Roll 2d20 and combine the results.

| **20**  | Weapons       | Fuel          |

### Factions

Each region is dominated by one or more Factions, each with its own unique advantages, goals, and obstacles. They each should have one or more representatives, or **Agents**, tasked with helping complete a Faction's Agenda. Often **Agents** will have personal motivations that differ from the Faction's main **Agenda**, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain.

Roll one or more times on the [Faction Types](#faction-types), [Faction Traits](#faction-traits), [Faction Advantages](#faction-advantages) and [Faction Agendas](#faction-agendas) tables.

### Topography

A region's terrain and natural features are an essential part of any map, affecting the local history, resources, settlements, culture, and more.

#### Landmarks 

**Landmarks** are unique, visible POIs that can also be used as geographic reference points: towers, mountains, tall buildings, and so on. They help orient travelers around the map, and are _especially_ visible from areas with higher elevation or a clear viewpoint. Landmarks are _represented on the map by a triangle_.

#### Draw Terrain

- Roll **3d6**, collecting any dice that roll off the page and setting them aside.
- Draw long, curvy lines across the page, carving up the map around each die. 
- Roll on the relevant table for each result, writing the terrain type on the map.
  - Replace the die with a triangle, writing the Landmark result beneath.
  - Reroll any dice that rolled off the page, following the earlier process as before. 
  - If there are any empty spaces in need of terrain, roll a die anywhere you like and use the face-up result as before.

### Terrain Die Drop Table

#### Rivers, Seas, and Lakes

Every region should have some kind of water source. Otherwise, where would the locals get their drinking water, or receive news from the rest of the realm? 

To create water, draw a wiggly line from the highest elevation point (i.e. Mountains) to the lowest (i.e. Plains). If the river runs through terrain that is higher in elevation, it might terminate in a **lake**. If your map has a sea, it might terminate there. Otherwise, the river can continue on off the map page.

### Weather

The weather can have a great impact on the people, culture, and terrain of a region. It impacts what kinds of clothes the adventurers need to wear, what sorts of tools they'll have to bring, and how tough the journey might be. To determine the average weather of a region, roll on the [Seasonal Weather](#seasonal-weather) table once for each season. Optionally, you may also roll on the [Unusual Weather](#unusual-weather) table around particular landmarks or terrain.

| **6**   | Fog there fills the belly (no need for rations). Tomorrow, vomiting.                                        |
| **7**   | The winds carry whispers of voices. Some say they tell hints of the future.                                 |
| **8**   | Shadows disappear at random. Animals are reluctant to enter.                                                |
| **9**   | Flashes of movement in the periphery that always amount to nothing.                                         |
| **10**  | The air is thicker than usual, and breathing is difficult.                                                  |
| **11**  | Periodic rains of small aquatic creatures (tadpoles, frogs, small fish). No one knows where they come from. |
| **12**  | An aurora that is visible even during the day.                                                              |
| **13**  | When it snows, the flakes are warm and dry.                                                                 |
| **14**  | The moon appears larger, and softly hums at night.                                                          |
| **15**  | An annual fog appears randomly, turning metallic surfaces to gold on contact.                               |
| **16**  | Birds fly backwards, yet somehow still move forward.                                                        |
| **17**  | The rain glows gently at night. It can be gathered, but the light eventually fades.                         |
| **18**  | The stars arrange themselves in intricate patterns, making navigation difficult.                            |
| **19**  | Enormous, fleshy eyes peer down from the skies, their pupils lighting up the night sky.                     |
| **20**  | For half the year the sky is bare of moon and stars, and the land is pitch-black.                           |

### Put It All Together

Ask yourself the following questions:

- How does the region's terrain effect the people that live here? 
- What would draw people to this region? What keeps them here?
- How do the people here think of outsiders? How do outsiders think of them?
- What power do the Factions have over the people who live here?
- Who or what threatens their Agenda?
- How would the Faction interact with any newcomers (i.e. an adventuring party)?

You should now have a sufficient idea about the people and terrain of this region, and are finally ready to form these results into a coherent theme. 

For example, if I rolled up a people that were there religious and sought conversion, I'd assume they were a proud folk, but prone to religious extremes and proselytizing. And if their primary resources were land, yet spices were rare, I'd assume they grew their own food, but that due to a religious prohibition their cuisine was often bland.

Presume that I also rolled up a ruling Faction of Nomads, whose primary Advantage was their conviction, I would assume the elites were a class of religious chiefs. If the Faction's Agenda was to cultivate a rare resource, but that they were hindered by cultural taboos, I might decide that they had hired the party to take on the task. Perhaps the object of their quest was a unique plant, only grown in a distant place, and that the mission must remain a secret? 
 
Finally, the party would meet with one of the Faction's Agents, a spy posing as a Peddler. Only she could tell them where the plant grew, and how to cultivate it.

## Points of Interest

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Heart**: The primary settlement in a region. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place, but it should always be significant to the region's history and people. 
- **Settlements**: Permanent, largely self-sufficient population centers, typically governed by a political body or faction. 
- **Waypoints**: A safe place to refill supplies, get a good night's sleep, or get directions. Often rely on travelers for survival, but provide necessary services.
- **Curiosities**: A wilderness locale of note, somewhere remarkable or strange. It may indeed be hazardous, but only if the PCs interact with it.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Dungeons**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.

### Draw Points of Interest

- Draw the letter **H** close to a water source on the map. 
- Roll **6d6** on the map, collecting any dice that roll off the page and setting them aside. These are the maps's Points of Interest.
- Remove each die, noting the face up result according to the [POI Die Drop Table](#poi-die-drop-table) on the page. For example, the number 4 would indicate a Lair, denoted by the letter "L" on the page. 
- Roll any dice that fell off the map page, repeating the previous process until no dice are remaining.
- Starting with the Heart, number each POI on the map.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each POI, including the Heart and all Landmarks. Note the results for each in your notebook.

> Some POIs may allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

## Paths

**Paths** act as geographic connectors on the map, ranging from well-traveled roads and trails to rough wilderness routes. Paths should provide compelling choices between POIs, who must weigh factors such as safety, speed, and travel difficulty. 

### Path Types

- **Standard** paths are obvious or well-trod routes between two POIs. _Represented by a thick line._
- **Hidden** paths do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. _Represented by a dashed line._
- **Conditional** paths may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. _Represented by a crossed line._

### Draw Paths

- Starting with the Heart, create 1-4 paths between each location. 
  - Create loops, branching paths, dead-ends, and shortcuts between POIs.
  - Some paths may be parts of a chain and tied to a particular terrain (mountain passes, rivers, etc.).
  - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
  - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Designate each path using the number of a POI and its connecting point, e.g. 1 &harr; 3. You can denote this in your notebook under the originating POI or in a separate section.  
- Decide whether a path represents a road, a trail, or a wilderness route and write the results in your notebook.
- Roll on the [Path Features](#path-features) table for each path, writing the results in your notebook. 
- Determine the path distances between POIs and note the duration on the map:
  - A short distance between POIs takes one Watch to traverse, a medium distance takes two Watches, and a long distance takes three Watches. 
  - For Trails add 1 more Watch, and for Wilderness routes add 2 additional Watches.
  - A Watch is 8 hours long. Denote days between POIs wherever possible (typically two Watches and one rest per day of travel).
