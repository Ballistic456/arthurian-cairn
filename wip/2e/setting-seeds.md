# Setting Seeds

## Overview


1. Create the region's theme from its topography, natural features, people, and resources.
2. Build paths and POIs.
3. Terminate via borders.


## Theme

- Roll on the [Topography](#topography) table and record the results.
  - What effects does the region's dominant terrain have on the people that live there? 
  - What would draw someone there, and why would they stay? 
  - How does are the region's borders shaped by the terrain of its neighbors?
- Roll on the [People](#people) table and record the result.
  - How do the people that live there perceive themselves, and how others perceive them?
- Roll on the [Resources](#resources) table and record the results.
   - What resources are in abundance, and what are scarce? 
   - How do these factors relate to the other aspects of the region, and how does it shape the people that live there?

## The Map

Points of Interest on a map (or POIs) are generally divided into the following categories:  
- **Settlement**: Any civilized community larger than a single family or religious order. Typically a village, town, or city. 
- **Landmarks**: A significant geographic signpost. Crumbling bridges, megaliths, face-shaped outcrop, and so on.
- **Hazard**: A naturally occuring locale that should be avoided or circumnavigated.
- **Lairs**: A source of heightened monster activity, enemy encampment, or hive.
- **Ruins**: An explicitly dangerous locale, dungeon, or adventure site.
- **Refuge**: A safe, populated haven. An inn, monastery, sanctuary, prison, campground, etc.

### Paths

- **Standard**: A path typical to the region, lacking in special features.
- **Barrier**: A change in the biome's terrain that slows down or completely blocks further travel. Examples can include rivers, changes in elevation, thickly-grown trees, sinkholes, and more. 
- **Chain**: The path is a segment in a series, typically tied to terrain (mountain passes, rivers, trade routes, etc.).
- **Dead End**: Leads to a remote or isolated location.
- **Encounter**: The risk of peril is increased. Roll on the Wilderness Event table an extra time, and the chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Hidden**: A path not appearing on any known maps. Learning about them always require some kind of cost. Additionally, chance of getting lost increases by a step.
- **Shortcut**: A path that provides a significant boost in speed to another POI.

> Some paths may lead to POIs that allow the PCs to see more of the world than what appears on their map.

### Build the Map

#### Stage One

- On a flat sheet of paper draw a circle. This is the Heart of your adventure site. 
- Roll 4d12 and write the results around the circle as if it were a clock face. Ignore any duplicates. 
- Starting with the earliest "hour" on the clock face, roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table and draw the results.
  - If a Barrier was rolled, note that the path cuts through the region's border terrain. 

#### Stage Two
- Starting with the Heart, roll on the [POIs] table and draw the results at the terminus of each path. 
  - The **Heart** is always a **Settlement** of some kind. It isn't necessarily the largest or most important place in the setting, but it should be significant to the region's history.

#### Stage Three

- Roll on the [Path Types](#path-types) table again, creating **two** new paths for every POI _except_ for the Heart. 
  - Ignore any POIs that are at Dead Ends.
  - If a Chain was previously rolled, a future connecting path to that POI should also be a Chain of the same path type. 
  - Connect at least one of each new paths to an existing POI.
- Roll on the [POIs] table again, and draw the results at the terminus of each path.
- Repeat the process as you like.
- Number each POI, starting with the Heart.

> We can assume that all paths are one Watch long for this procedure, but if you'd like to make them longer, make sure to place more POIs along the way! 
> Also, don't focus too much on the specific traits of any Path or POI, at this time. That includes distance, path types (i.e. trails, roads, rivers, etc.) and other details (towns, Ruins, etc.).

| **3**  | Alpine    | Caverns canyons , cliffs, tundra    |


**Montane**: Starts where the forest line ends and extends up to the tree line, and is mostly forests and meadows.
**Subalpine**: Just below the alpine zone, characterized by harsher conditions than the montane and often features shrubland, meadows, and sparse forests.
**Alpine**: Above the tree line, this zone includes areas where trees cannot grow, featuring mostly grasslands, rocky terrain, and snowfields.

### More examples

- A vast tundra of glaciers, ice caves, and beasts long forgotten. Small settlements dot the frozen landscape, competing for food, warmth, and mates. A newly-appointed clan chief is uniting formerly warring tribes, building an army greater than any seen before. Now, their forces are digging into the Star Ridge mountains, searching the icy rivers for something - or someone -long-thought lost to time.
- Within a manufactured dome of alien technology, people live in relative harmony, united by the Benefactor, an immortal entity of powerful knowledge and perception. Crime is nearly obselete, as the Benefactor arrests its perpetrators before even their own intentions are known to themselves. There are those who say this system is unfair, organizing in secret to overthrow their perfect leader. Or so they think...
- Seven warring kingdoms jostle for a single landmass in an endless war. The greatest of these nations were corrupted from within, destroying a thousand-year old regime in a matter of months. Now their former enemies comb the lands of this once glorious nation, searching its bloated corpse for whatever riches may remain, all the while wondering who will be next?
- An archipelago boasting thousands of small islands, their biomes equally as diverse as their animals and plant life. Rival factions ride the crimson seas in search of a holy artifact that is prophesized to unite not only the broken clans, but the earth itself. 
- A post-apocalyptic wasteland littered with ancient technology, derelict sky-ships, and ruled by the Time Wizards. Cracked deserts and spiral forests encroach the last megacity, the only true respite from their cruelty.
