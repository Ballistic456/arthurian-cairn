# How Do Bonds and Omens Work?

## Introduction

Bonds and Omens provide new characters with adventure hooks, starting gear, and abilities. And while they are distinct from character Backgrounds they are equally useful for building a setting, or even a single adventure!

## Bonds Should...

- Give a character an item (often _petty_) _or_ a unique ability.
- Encourage character engagement with the implied setting.
- Flesh out a character's history without relying on events tied to specific Backgrounds. 
- Provide a character with a quest, opportunity, or plan of action. 

## Omens Should...

- Never rely on a specific player character for relevance.
- Alway tell the characters something about the setting they did not already know.
- Reveal a pattern or other obvious indicator that something terrible is going on.
