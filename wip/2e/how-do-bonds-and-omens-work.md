# How Do Bonds and Omens Work?

## Introduction

Bonds and Omens provide characters with adventure hooks, starting gear, and abilities. And while they are distinct from a Backgrounds, they are equally useful for building a setting, or even a single adventure! 

## Principles

- Bonds should provide a single item (generally _petty_) _or_ a unique ability.
