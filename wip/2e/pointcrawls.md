# Pointcrawls

## Creating a Pointcrawl

- Number any potential points of interest on the map.
- Identify potential routes between each point, noting obvious roads and trails. Indicate any sites that lack connecting routes to other points. 
- Indicate the rough travel time (in days) between any two points, accounting for the party's speed, terrain, weather, and other elements of play that might affect the journey. 

#### Pointcrawl Example

[![Alt text](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/pointcrawl_example.jpg)

The travel times between each point were determined as follows (assuming that the party is travelling by foot):
- The journey between points **1** to **2** is 6 watches:  
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains and forests.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain, and 2 watches for the forest.
- The journey between **2** and **3** takes 4 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the mountains.
  - Add three watches for the _Perilous_ mountain terrain.
- The journey between **2** and **4** takes three watches:
  - No penalty for traveling on a maintained road.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
  - Add one additional watch for the _extra long_ forest journey.
- The journey between **4** and **5** takes four watches: 
  - Add one watch for the trail through the swamp.
  - Add one watch for the _Perilous_ swamp terrain.
- The journey between **4** and **6** takes 3 watches:
  - Add one watch for the trail through the woods.
  - Add two watches for the _Tough_ forest terrain.
- The journey to **7** from anywhere should consider:
  -  +2 for traveling through the wilderness
  -  +2 for traveling through the _Tough_ forest terrain.
  -  +1 watch if traveling from further away.
