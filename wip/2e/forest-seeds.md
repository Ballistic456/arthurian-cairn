# Forest Seeds

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. However unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can go take shortcuts, go "off-trail," or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Follow the _Dungeon_ exploration procedures found in the Player's Guide, but rather than rolling for Dungeon Events, use the Wilderness Events table instead.
- If the party attempts to step off the trail and cut through the forest, the Warden should make any associated costs clear. Added travel time, effort, special tools that may be required, and any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- Rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much daylight is available, whether a suitable area is available for rest, and what the costs or dangers associated nighttime exploration may be. 

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest's inhabitants.
2. Create forest zones and add landmarks.
3. Create points.
4. Create the trails.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name the forest.

## Forest Denizens

In some ways the Wood is a single entity, its brain alive within every tree and plant, connected via a network of thorn and branch. The animals and plants are its limbs, directing the wants, desires, fears, and needs. The creatures that live within its boundaries are its blood, answering its call by delivering much needed defenses and rebuffing interlopers. The Wood will always protect itself, and its children. Roll on the Traits table, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the forest.

## Create the Map

### Forest Topography

A forest can be broken up into zones, each defined by distinct **Zones** and **Landmarks**. The zones describe how outsiders perceive the Wood, and landmarks help travelers navigate through the dense foliage, acting as geographic reference points: unusually tall trees, towers, and so on. Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though a few are large enough to stand out from the green. Some landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

- Roll **1d6** on the table, then roll an amount of dice equal to that number on the map. Ignore any dice that roll off the page.
- Draw long, curvy lines across the page, carving up the map around each die. These represent areas where the forest shifts and changes.
- Roll on the [Forest Zones](#forest-zones) table for each result, noting the forest type on the map. 
  - Replace the die with a triangle and write the landmark result on the map.

### Create POIs

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Shelter**, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- Select two opposite points, preferably close to the page border. These are the forest's entrance and exit.
- Starting with the entrance and ending at the exit, number each POI on the map.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 

#### Forest Die Drop Table

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| **d6**  | **POI** |
| **1**   | Monster |
| **2-3** | Ruins   |
| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

## Trails

### Trail Types

- **Standard** trails are obvious or well-trod routes between two POIs. _Represented by a thick line._
- **Hidden** trails do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. _Represented by a dashed line._
- **Conditional** trails may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. _Represented by a crossed line._

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 trails between each point. 
 - Create loops, branching trails, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
 - Some trails are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some trails are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook.

| **20**  | War Route          | Tree Carvings      |

> If some of the results seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn these juxtapositions into questions like "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature one might encounter in the forest. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not "waiting around" for characters to stumble upon them, but have their own wants and goals. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

#### Shelter

Despite it wild & unpredictable nature, there have always been those brave, skilled, or foolhardy enough to try and build a life in the Wood. And some do succeed, leaving their mark via smoldering campfire or gray tower, offering a welcome respite to weary travelers.

#### Hazard

The Wood is a dangerous place, and not to be trifled with. The forest and its inhabitants do what they must to survive, and even sated are still preparing for their next meal. The trees, the plants, and the earth itself will leave deadly traps and dangers to root out those unworthy to pass beneath the boughs.
