# Forest Seeds

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. And unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can take shortcuts by going "off-trail" or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Dungeon exploration rules are _in effect_, including ruling on the Dungeon Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- If the party attempts to reach a point by going "off-trail" (bushwhacking), the **Warden** should make any associated costs clear: typically time, effort (**Fatigue**), or any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc. while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore each connected point. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day. 

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest's inhabitants.
2. Create points.
3. Create the trails.
4. Create trail markers and spoor.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name each point.
7. Name the forest.

## Create the Map

### Forest Topography

Each forest is unique, 

### Landmarks

**Landmarks** are unique, visible POIs that can also be used as geographic reference points: unusually tall trees, towers, and so on. Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though some may be large enough to stand out from the green. Some landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

- Roll **1d6** on the table, then roll an amount of dice equal to that number on the map. Ignore any dice that roll off the page.
- Draw long, curvy lines across the page, carving up the map around each die. These represent areas where the forest shifts and changes.
- Roll on the [Forest Types](#forest-types) table for each result, noting the forest type on the map. 
  - Replace the die with a triangle and write the landmark result on the map.

#### Forest Types

### Create POIs

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Shelter**, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- Select two opposite points, preferably close to the page border. These are the forest's entrance and exit.
- Starting with the entrance and ending at the exit, number each POI on the map.

#### Forest Die Drop Table

|         |         |
| ------- | ------- |
| **d6**  | **POI** |
| **1**   | Monster |
| **2-3** | Ruins   |
| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 trails between each point. 
 - Create loops, branching trails, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
 - Some trails are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some trails are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook. 

#### Trail Types

Roll 2d20 and combine the results.

| **19**  | Treeline Heights   | Swaying Plants     |
| **20**  | War Route          | Tree Carvings      |

> If some of the results seem incongruous, that's OK! Create questions from the juxtaposition, such as "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

### Stock the POIs

- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 
- For each point, filter the table results through the theme you generated earlier in this process. 

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature that live in the forest. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not "waiting around" for characters to stumble upon them, but have their own wants and goals. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

#### Ruins

Forests are wild places, but that does not mean people haven't tried to tame them. The remnants of these attempts still show up from time to time, hinting at the folly of those who would stand against the Wood.

#### Shelter

#### Hazard

The Wood is a dangerous place, and not to be trifled with. The forest and its inhabitants do what they must to survive, and even sated are still preparing for their next meal. Even the trees, plants, and even the earth itself will leave deadly traps and dangers to root out those unworthy to pass beneath the boughs.

## Example Forest

### Draw Trails

- We start by creating the structure of our forest, drawing the first dot representing the **Heart** in the central, Southern part of the region.
- We then draw the **trunk**, creating a gentle curve towards the Northwest.
- Then we draw three **branches** extending from the **trunk**, one towards the East (closer to the **Heart**) and the other towards the West and further North. 
- We then draw a single **twig** off of each **branch**.
- We draw a dot at every terminal point. 
- Finally we connect two dots to other trails in our forest.

### Number Dots

- First we assign numbers, starting with the **Heart** at 11. In total, we have 7 dots for the Points: 
- `1` is our **Heart**.
- `2` is at the beginning (or end) of the **trunk**. 
- `4`, `5`, and `6`, are each at the end of a **branch**.
- `3` and `7` are each at the end of **twigs**, to the East and West of the **trunk** respectively. 

### Assign Trail Markers

For each trail we'll roll on the **Trail Markers** table (**d12**):

  - For the **trunk** we got a **6** (_Old Logging Road_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **3** (_Fae Passage_).
  - For the Western **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **4** (_Bandit's Run_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** farthest from the **Heart** we got a **5** (_Pilgrim's Footpath_).
  - For the loopeing trails that we made last, we got a **12** (_War Route_) and a **7** (_Trail Tree_).  

### Assign Trail Spoor

- For each Trail we roll on the [Spoor Types](#spoor-types) table. 
- For the _Old Logging Road_ we rolled a **4** (Enormous Footprints).
- For the _Fae Passage_ we rolled a **12** (Fresh Spiderwebs).
- For the _Bandit's Run_ we rolled a **13** (Archaic Tree Carvings).
- For the _Pilgrim's Footpath_ we rolled an **18** (Swaying Plants).
- For the _War Route_ we rolled a **14** (Dozens of Stone Piles)
- For the _Trail Tree_ we rolled a **13** (Claw Marks).

### Assign Points

Next we'll roll on the provided tables to generate features for each point. First roll a **d20** on the [Special](#special) table to create the **Heart (1)**. We got an **11** (_Elf Queen's Pavilion_).

For each remaining point, we first roll on the [point Types](#point-types) table, then on the associated table:
- **(2)**: We roll a **d6**: a **4** (Hazard). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Hazards](#hazards) table: a **6** (_Thorny Thickets_).
- **(3)**: We roll a **d6**: a **5** (Landmark). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Landmarks](#landmarks) table: an **11** (_Cathedral of Trees_).
- **(4)**: We roll a **d6**: **1** (Settlement). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Settlement](#settlements) table: a **9** (_Monastic Retreat_). We also roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table with a **d20**: a **20** (Renowned for its scholars).
- **(5)**: We roll a **d6**: **2** (Ruins). Roll a **d12** on the [Ruins](#ruins) table: a **4** (_Crumbled Crypt_).
- **(6)**: We roll a **d6**: **3** (Lair). Roll a **d12** on the [Lairs](#lairs) table: an **8** (_Goblin Hideaway_).
- **(7)**: We roll a **d6**: **6** (Special). Roll a **d20** on the Special table: a **5** (_Will-o'-Wisps_).

### Create Encounters

Next, we create forest encounters by rolling a **d20** on the [Forest Encounters](#forest-encounters) table for each point.

1. We roll an **8**: _Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers._
2. We roll a **17**: _A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable._
3. We roll a **15**: _A wounded animal, whining pitifully as it limps._
4. We roll a **2**: _The remnants of an old watchtower hidden in dense forest growth._
5. We roll a **7**: _A gnarled tree trunk bearing an uncannily carved face on its trunk._
6. We roll a **3**: _A snarling pack of wolves surrounding a fresh kill._
7. We roll a **6**: _A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between._

### Naming

We will now name each point using the [Location Names](#location-names) table. I took some liberties here, smashing together words I liked with other words from the list.

1. **Heart (Elf Queen's Pavilion)**: _Glintleaf Dell_
2. **(Thorny Thickets)**: _Thistlefield_
3. **(Cathedral of Trees)**: _Timbertop Spire_
4. **(Monastic Retreat)**: _Cloister of the Quiet Wood_
5. **(Crumbled Crypt)**: _Shattered Barrow_
6. **(Goblin Hideaway)**: _Mossbreak Nook_
7. **(Will-o'-Wisps)**: _Glimmerglade_

### Naming Our Forest

Finally, we roll on the [Forest Names](#forest-names) table, getting a **4** and then a **6** (or 46) for the adjective, "Luminous". Then we roll again, getting a **10** and a **5** (or 15) for the noun, "Weald." Our forest is called **The Luminous Weald**.

### Conclusion 

#### The Luminous Weald

[![Alt text](/img/2e/forestcrawl.png "Click to embiggen"){:height="80%" width="80%"}](/img/2e/forestcrawl.png)

> I've added a backdrop from the wonderful [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) to give it more flavor. 

#### Trails in The Weald

- _Old Logging Road_: Runs Northwest, connecting **Glintleaf Dell** to **Thistlefield**. Logging tracks cut into the ground the entire length of the trail. Enormous footprints are visible in the caked mud.
- _Fae Passage_: Runs Northeast, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Shattered Barrow** and **Glimmerglade**. The air feels heavy here. Covered in fresh spiderwebs. 
- _Bandit's Run_: Runs West, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Timpertop Spire** and **Mossbreak Nook**. The entry is partly hidden, but ancient tree carvings indicate its presence.
- _Pilgrim's Footpath_: Runs East from the _Old Logging Road_. Ends at the **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**. The comfortable trail is lined by odd, swaying plants line both sides of the trail.
- _War Route_: Connects **Timbertop Spire** to the _Old Logging Road_. The path is wide but heavily pitted here. Stones are stacked along the road in an intrictate arrangement as a memorial to the last war. 
- _Trail Tree_: Connects **Glimmberglade** to the _Pilgrim's Footpath_. A bent tree indicates that there is safety towards the Northeast. Ugly claw marks scar the otherwise healthy tree.  

#### Points of Interest in The Weald

1. **Glintleaf Dell**: The heart of the forest. In the center is a small pond, where Naiads with dagger-like teeth frolic. A palatial stone stage is built on one side, topped by a gold-leaf arch. Here, the Elf Queen meets her subjects.
2. **Thistlefield**: This area is overrun with thick bushes, forming a dense, nearly impassable thicket of thorns. It acts as a barrier of sorts, as just beyond lie the wide meadows of the West.
3. **Timbertop Spire**: A heavily wooded area featuring tall, majestic oak trees arranged in an unnatural yet pleasing pattern, evoking a sense of reverence in its visitors. A wounded animal whines pitifully within this sacred grove.
4. **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**: A monastery repurposed from an old military outpost. The only items allowed beyond the decrepit watchtower standing before it are books, as this particular order is well-known for its scholarly research.
5. **Shattered Barrow**: A collapsed crypt, blanketed in moss and ivy. An uncanny, scarred face is carved into a nearby enormous oak tree.
6. **Mossbreak Nook**: A Goblin hideout, completely obscured by the heavily-mossed trees surrounding it. In a small nearby glade, a pack of snarling wolves surrounds a freshly killed fae-touched deer.
7. **Glimmerglade**: A lovely meadow nestled beneath an impressive willow tree. In the center, blue-white wings flutter about a circle of perfect red mushrooms. At night, Will-o'-Wisps descend from the willow's boughs to feast.
