# Forest Seeds

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. And unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can take shortcuts by going "off-trail" or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Dungeon exploration rules are _in effect_, including ruling on the Dungeon Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- If the party attempts to reach a point by going "off-trail" (bushwhacking), the **Warden** should make any associated costs clear: typically time, effort (**Fatigue**), or any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- If the party is interrupted, stops to investigate something, rest, etc. while exploring a forested zone, there may not be enough time to fully explore each connected point. In these cases, rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much time is left in the day. 

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **forest map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest's inhabitants.
2. Create points.
3. Create the trails.
4. Create trail markers and spoor.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name each point.
7. Name the forest.

## Create the Map

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **R** would indicate a **Ruin**, denoted by the letter "R" on the page.
- Select up to two opposite points closest to the page border. These are the forest's entrances.
- Starting with either entrance, number each POI on the map.

- **Monster**
- **Ruins**:
- **Shelter**:
- **Hazard**:

#### Forest Die Drop Table

| **d6**  | **POI** |
| **1**   | Monster |
| **2-3** | Ruins   |
| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

### Stock the Rooms

- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 
- For each point, filter the table results through the theme you generated earlier in this process. 

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature that lives in a dungeon. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not simply "waiting around" for the characters to find them, but instead have their own wants and goals, even if they are simply looking for their next meal. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, create 1-4 trails between each point. 
 - Create loops, branching trails, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
 - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
 - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
- Create intersections (crossed lines) with no rooms in between.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook.

### Landmarks

Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though some may be large enough to stand out from the green. At times, landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

| **1**   | A patch of perfectly round toadstools. Blue-white wings flutter between, their wings humming a hypnotic tune. | A circle of standing stones, overgrown with moss. No grass grows in their shadow.                   |
| **2**   | A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable. Something shiny glints just beyond.                             | A fairy circle, covered in black moss. Something about it feels off.                                |
| **3**   | A dryad sits atop a stone, a purple fungus lining her arms. There is a violence to her eyes.                  | A great oak has been felled, perhaps by lightning. A large hole is rent on one side.                |
| **4**   | A gnarled tree trunk with an uncannily carved face on its trunk.                                              | A lone Woodwose stands directly on the path ahead, holding a large stick.                           |
| **5**   | A hillside cave, wafting the scent of damp and decay. Within, a stone statue of some forgotten deity.         | A robed woman is tending to a wounded animal, whispering in its ear.                                |
| **6**   | A massive boulder blocks the path ahead. It is actually a buried troll, turned to stone by the sun.           | A rotted, vine-covered cabin, clearly abandoned long ago. A delicious smell wafts from the window.  |
| **7**   | A patch of quicksand disguised as soft ground. A broken spool of rope lies nearby.                            | A small bearded man argues with a squawking raven. It holds something shiny in its beak.            |
| **8**   | A snarling pack of wolves surround a fresh kill. They are not keen to share.                                  | A tiny hovel is nestled in a tree's roots. The smell of baking bread wafts out.                     |
| **9**   | A spectacular waterfall, spraying rainbows high. A silver horn splits the cascade, its owner obscured.        | A tree, all but consumed by blight. In its boughs, something cries out as if trapped.               |
| **10**  | A trap, hastily set and poorly concealed. It smells strongly of urine.                                        | A trio of satyrs playing and dancing to music. They seem ignorant of any observation.               |
| **11**  | A tree acting as makeshift bridge over a glittering stream. It appears sturdy.                                | A troll sits holding a mirror, engaged in deep conversation with its own reflection.                |
| **12**  | A trio of ravens circle ominously overhead. Suddenly they burst into action, diving down into the bush.       | A windless glade with a large willow at the center. It sways softly, as if to some unseen breeze.   |
| **13**  | A wide river where otters are playing with something shiny. It appears to be a small suit of armor.           | Dozens of smallfolk have setup a market here, trading forest goods. Their wares are impressive.     |
| **14**  | A Woodwife gathers herbs, singing a melancholic song. She disappears into the wood if provoked.               | In the crook of a hollow tree, six ravens squawk and preen. If observed they stare back in silence. |
| **15**  | A wounded animal, whining pitifully and limping. There is intelligence in its eyes.                           | Sleeping peacefully atop two boughs, a giant is snoring. The ground vibrates in response.           |
| **16**  | An old watchtower, hidden by dense forest growth. Something larger looms just around the bend.                | The path ends at a small pond. The water looks pure, but something moves subtly within.             |
| **17**  | Bees swarm protectively around a tree brimming with honeycombs. A cloaked figure silently observes nearby.    | Statues of warriors, their faces lined with horror.                                                 |
| **18**  | Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers.                                       | A maze, invisible save for a faint shimmer.                                                         |
| **19**  | Shadowy figures dart between the trees. Hushed voices call out to one another.                                | Footprints that glow faintly under moonlight, but vanish when touched.                              |
| **20**  | Wild berries grow here in abundance. None have been eaten, not even by birds.                                 | A flower that changes color based on the emotions of those nearby.                                  |

## Example Forest

### Draw Trails

- We start by creating the structure of our forest, drawing the first dot representing the **Heart** in the central, Southern part of the region.
- We then draw the **trunk**, creating a gentle curve towards the Northwest.
- Then we draw three **branches** extending from the **trunk**, one towards the East (closer to the **Heart**) and the other towards the West and further North. 
- We then draw a single **twig** off of each **branch**.
- We draw a dot at every terminal point. 
- Finally we connect two dots to other trails in our forest.

### Number Dots

- First we assign numbers, starting with the **Heart** at 11. In total, we have 7 dots for the Points: 
- `1` is our **Heart**.
- `2` is at the beginning (or end) of the **trunk**. 
- `4`, `5`, and `6`, are each at the end of a **branch**.
- `3` and `7` are each at the end of **twigs**, to the East and West of the **trunk** respectively. 

### Assign Trail Markers

For each trail we'll roll on the **Trail Markers** table (**d12**):

  - For the **trunk** we got a **6** (_Old Logging Road_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **3** (_Fae Passage_).
  - For the Western **branch** closest to the **Heart** we got a **4** (_Bandit's Run_).
  - For the Eastern **branch** farthest from the **Heart** we got a **5** (_Pilgrim's Footpath_).
  - For the loopeing trails that we made last, we got a **12** (_War Route_) and a **7** (_Trail Tree_).  

### Assign Trail Spoor

- For each Trail we roll on the [Spoor Types](#spoor-types) table. 
- For the _Old Logging Road_ we rolled a **4** (Enormous Footprints).
- For the _Fae Passage_ we rolled a **12** (Fresh Spiderwebs).
- For the _Bandit's Run_ we rolled a **13** (Archaic Tree Carvings).
- For the _Pilgrim's Footpath_ we rolled an **18** (Swaying Plants).
- For the _War Route_ we rolled a **14** (Dozens of Stone Piles)
- For the _Trail Tree_ we rolled a **13** (Claw Marks).

### Assign Points

Next we'll roll on the provided tables to generate features for each point. First roll a **d20** on the [Special](#special) table to create the **Heart (1)**. We got an **11** (_Elf Queen's Pavilion_).

For each remaining point, we first roll on the [point Types](#point-types) table, then on the associated table:
- **(2)**: We roll a **d6**: a **4** (Hazard). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Hazards](#hazards) table: a **6** (_Thorny Thickets_).
- **(3)**: We roll a **d6**: a **5** (Landmark). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Landmarks](#landmarks) table: an **11** (_Cathedral of Trees_).
- **(4)**: We roll a **d6**: **1** (Settlement). Now we roll a **d12** on the [Settlement](#settlements) table: a **9** (_Monastic Retreat_). We also roll on the [Settlement Features](#settlement-features) table with a **d20**: a **20** (Renowned for its scholars).
- **(5)**: We roll a **d6**: **2** (Ruins). Roll a **d12** on the [Ruins](#ruins) table: a **4** (_Crumbled Crypt_).
- **(6)**: We roll a **d6**: **3** (Lair). Roll a **d12** on the [Lairs](#lairs) table: an **8** (_Goblin Hideaway_).
- **(7)**: We roll a **d6**: **6** (Special). Roll a **d20** on the Special table: a **5** (_Will-o'-Wisps_).

### Create Encounters

Next, we create forest encounters by rolling a **d20** on the [Forest Encounters](#forest-encounters) table for each point.

1. We roll an **8**: _Naiads splashing in a small pond. Their teeth are fanged, like daggers._
2. We roll a **17**: _A dense thicket of thorns, nearly impassable._
3. We roll a **15**: _A wounded animal, whining pitifully as it limps._
4. We roll a **2**: _The remnants of an old watchtower hidden in dense forest growth._
5. We roll a **7**: _A gnarled tree trunk bearing an uncannily carved face on its trunk._
6. We roll a **3**: _A snarling pack of wolves surrounding a fresh kill._
7. We roll a **6**: _A circle of perfect mushrooms. Blue-white wings flutter between._

### Naming

We will now name each point using the [Location Names](#location-names) table. I took some liberties here, smashing together words I liked with other words from the list.

1. **Heart (Elf Queen's Pavilion)**: _Glintleaf Dell_
2. **(Thorny Thickets)**: _Thistlefield_
3. **(Cathedral of Trees)**: _Timbertop Spire_
4. **(Monastic Retreat)**: _Cloister of the Quiet Wood_
5. **(Crumbled Crypt)**: _Shattered Barrow_
6. **(Goblin Hideaway)**: _Mossbreak Nook_
7. **(Will-o'-Wisps)**: _Glimmerglade_

### Naming Our Forest

Finally, we roll on the [Forest Names](#forest-names) table, getting a **4** and then a **6** (or 46) for the adjective, "Luminous". Then we roll again, getting a **10** and a **5** (or 15) for the noun, "Weald." Our forest is called **The Luminous Weald**.

### Conclusion 

#### The Luminous Weald

> I've added a backdrop from the wonderful [Perilous Shores](https://watabou.itch.io/perilous-shores) to give it more flavor. 

#### Trails in The Weald

- _Old Logging Road_: Runs Northwest, connecting **Glintleaf Dell** to **Thistlefield**. Logging tracks cut into the ground the entire length of the trail. Enormous footprints are visible in the caked mud.
- _Fae Passage_: Runs Northeast, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Shattered Barrow** and **Glimmerglade**. The air feels heavy here. Covered in fresh spiderwebs. 
- _Bandit's Run_: Runs West, an offshoot of the _Old Logging Road_. Connects to **Timpertop Spire** and **Mossbreak Nook**. The entry is partly hidden, but ancient tree carvings indicate its presence.
- _Pilgrim's Footpath_: Runs East from the _Old Logging Road_. Ends at the **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**. The comfortable trail is lined by odd, swaying plants line both sides of the trail.
- _War Route_: Connects **Timbertop Spire** to the _Old Logging Road_. The path is wide but heavily pitted here. Stones are stacked along the road in an intrictate arrangement as a memorial to the last war. 
- _Trail Tree_: Connects **Glimmberglade** to the _Pilgrim's Footpath_. A bent tree indicates that there is safety towards the Northeast. Ugly claw marks scar the otherwise healthy tree.  

#### Points of Interest in The Weald

1. **Glintleaf Dell**: The heart of the forest. In the center is a small pond, where Naiads with dagger-like teeth frolic. A palatial stone stage is built on one side, topped by a gold-leaf arch. Here, the Elf Queen meets her subjects.
2. **Thistlefield**: This area is overrun with thick bushes, forming a dense, nearly impassable thicket of thorns. It acts as a barrier of sorts, as just beyond lie the wide meadows of the West.
3. **Timbertop Spire**: A heavily wooded area featuring tall, majestic oak trees arranged in an unnatural yet pleasing pattern, evoking a sense of reverence in its visitors. A wounded animal whines pitifully within this sacred grove.
4. **Cloister of the Quiet Wood**: A monastery repurposed from an old military outpost. The only items allowed beyond the decrepit watchtower standing before it are books, as this particular order is well-known for its scholarly research.
5. **Shattered Barrow**: A collapsed crypt, blanketed in moss and ivy. An uncanny, scarred face is carved into a nearby enormous oak tree.
6. **Mossbreak Nook**: A Goblin hideout, completely obscured by the heavily-mossed trees surrounding it. In a small nearby glade, a pack of snarling wolves surrounds a freshly killed fae-touched deer.
7. **Glimmerglade**: A lovely meadow nestled beneath an impressive willow tree. In the center, blue-white wings flutter about a circle of perfect red mushrooms. At night, Will-o'-Wisps descend from the willow's boughs to feast.
