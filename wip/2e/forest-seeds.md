# Forest Seeds

## Forestcrawls

A forestcrawl is a simple method for exploring a large forested area, typically made up of branching trails connecting scattered points of interest. While a forestcrawl has some of the same properties as a traditional dungeon delve, it swaps stone walls and ceilings for the dense, non-linear design of a heavily wooded area. Instead of rooms, points of interest are defined as clearings or major changes in the forested landscape. However unlike exploring a dungeon, characters can go take shortcuts, go "off-trail," or climb trees to get a better look ahead (with a cost, of course).   

### Exploring The Wood

- Follow the _Dungeon_ exploration procedures found in the Player's Guide, but rather than rolling for Dungeon Events, use the Wilderness Events table instead.
- If the party attempts to step off the trail and cut through the forest, the Warden should make any associated costs clear. Added travel time, effort, special tools that may be required, and any obvious dangers. Going off-trail also automatically triggers a roll on the Wilderness Events table.
- Points in a forestcrawl are close to each other. When traveling on clearly marked trails, a small forest zone (10-15 POIs) can be explored in its entirety in a single Watch.
- Rely on the fiction and common sense to determine how much daylight is available, whether a suitable area is available for rest, and what the costs or dangers associated nighttime exploration may be. 

## Creating a Forest

Follow this procedure for any forested terrain in a region. If a conflict or interesting pattern emerges, be open to restating or modifying any earlier results! 

### Materials Required

- A sheet of paper and a notebook. Letter/A4 is fine.
- Pencils and erasers. Colored pencils or crayons are good, too.
- At least one d6 and one d20, but 6d6 and 2d20 would be ideal.

> Going forward, we will refer to the sheet of paper as the **map**.
> As with any other rule, if you don't like a table result, roll again or tweak as desired!

### Overview

1. Define the forest.
2. Define the forest's inhabitants.
3. Create points.
4. Create the trails.
5. Create forest encounters.
6. Name the forest.

## Forest Description

Roll on the [Forest Description](#forest-description) and write the results in your notebook. This table both indicates how outsiders perceive the forest as well as any unique natural features it may have. If the forested terrain was generated using the methods described in the Setting Seeds chapter, consider how the associated Landmark affects it as well.

> Landmarks help travelers navigate through the dense foliage, acting as geographic reference points: unusually tall trees, watchtowers, and so on. Most forest landmarks are visible only by climbing a tree, though a few are large enough to stand out from the green. Some landmarks are _heard_ rather than seen.

## The Spirit of the Forest

In some ways the Wood is a single entity, its brain alive within every tree and plant, connected via a network of thorn and branch. The animals and plants are its limbs, directing the wants, desires, fears, and needs. The creatures that live within its boundaries are its blood, answering its call by delivering much needed defenses and rebuffing interlopers. The Wood will always protect itself, and its children. Roll on the [Traits](#traits) and [Forest Agenda](#forest-agenda) tables, writing the results in your notebook. This describes the general attitude of the creatures found in the forest as well as what the forest _wants_ as a whole.

## Create the Map

### Create POIs

- Roll **8-12 d6** dice on the dungeon map, ignoring any dice that fall off the page. These are the Points of Interest (POI) in the forest.
- Write the face-up results on the page according to the [Forest Die Drop Table](#forest-die-drop-table). For example, the number **4** would indicate a **Shelter**, denoted by the letter "S" on the page.
- Select two opposite points, preferably close to the page border. These are the forest's entrance and exit.
- Starting with the entrance and ending at the exit, number each POI on the map.
- Roll on the relevant tables for each point, writing the results in your notebook. 

#### Forest Die Drop Table

| **4**   | Shelter |
| **5-6** | Hazard  |

## Trails

### Trail Types

- **Standard** trails are obvious or well-trod routes between two points. _Represented by a thick line._
- **Hidden** trails do not appear on any known maps. Their discovery always requires some kind of cost. _Represented by a dashed line._
- **Conditional** trails may be blocked, or requires specialized tools (boats, climbing gear, etc.) to cross. Others may even be impossible to navigate without a map or guide. _Represented by a crossed line._

### Draw Trails

- Starting with the entrance, draw 1-4 paths between each point.
  - Create loops, branching paths, dead-ends, and shortcuts between points.
  - Some paths are Conditional, represented by a crossed line.
  - Some paths are Hidden, represented by a dashed line.
  - Create intersections (crossed lines) with no points in between.
- Create trails by drawing over paths that connect 3-4 points in an obvious, consistent, or interesting manner. 
  - Short, isolated paths between points and hidden paths are not usually a part of a trail.
  - Use colored pencils or crayons to help distinguish different trails.
- Roll on the [Trail Types](#trail-types) table for each trail, recording the results in your notebook.

> If some of the results seem incongruous, that's OK! Turn these juxtapositions into questions like "Why _is_ there an old logging road leading to the bandit's hideout?" That said, don't be afraid to choose a more appropriate result if you're having a hard time making it work!

#### Monster

Monsters are any dangerous creature one might encounter in the forest. This does not mean it will attack intruders by default! Monsters are not "waiting around" for characters to stumble upon them, but have their own wants and goals. Some monsters can talk, reason, and even beg for mercy. _People can be monsters, too_.

#### Shelter

#### Hazard

The Wood is a dangerous place, and not to be trifled with. The forest and its inhabitants do what they must to survive, and even sated are still preparing for their next meal. The trees, the plants, and the earth itself will leave deadly traps and dangers to root out those unworthy to pass beneath the boughs.

## Example Forest

### Map

[![Click Me!](/img/2e/forest-seed-example.webp "Click to embiggen"){:height="60%" width="60%"}](/img/2e/forest-seed-example.webp)

### The Forest

**Description**: Diseased, Frozen

A thick forest infected with disease and rot. Parts of it are frozen solid.

### Denizens

**Traits**: Stable, Territorial

Wish to return to the stability they once knew, but are threatened by ancient forest boundaries.

**Forest Agenda**: Purification, Infestation

The spirit of the forest wants nothing more than to purify itself of the disease that has taken hold. An infestation of Giant Spiders (**9**) have spun webs throughout, killing far too many creatures and undermining the ecosystem.

### Forest Theme

For decades, order and stability of the forest was kept in check through an agreement between the forest witch **Anglwyst** and **Dormin**, the Wood's champion. The witch would use her magic to keep the trees and animals healthy, while the champion would ensure that hunters only kill creatures deemed expendable, indicated by a shock with white in their fur. The pact was magical and impermeable, and the forest was divided, barring both the witch nor the champion from crossing its boundary.

After the old witch died, one of her spells grew wild, then dangerous. Now a magical disease has begun to infect the trees and creatures, threatening to consume the entire forest. Hunters call it the _Withering_, as the magic petrifies and then freezes everything it touches.

## Trails 

### Old Logging Road, Fresh Spiderwebs. 

The path between **1** and **5** is blocked by a broad cliff face, requiring climbing gear to ascend.  Giant spiders travel the hidden path between **9** and **6**, spinning their web all along the trail.

### Treeline Heights, Stone Piles

The ancient monks at **8** once climbed this path daily to pay their respects in the crystal chambers of **2**. They left piles of stone alongside the path for each of their fallen members.

### Foraging Path, Distant Singing

An old Witch once survived purely from the plentiful fruit on this trail. Her magic has outlived her now, including her obedient two-legged hut, the strange weather in **6**, and the faint sounds of an woman singing a lullaby.

### Dry Riverbed, Tree Carvings

A river once ran through West end of the forest, but dried up after the witch died. Her runes still mar the surface of some trees here.

### Hunter's Track, Peripheral Images

The hermit of **3** still hunts along this trail, obeying the laws of old. He is over 200 years old, and doesn't plan on dying until he's good and ready. Sometimes visions of him as a younger - and happier - man appear along the path, just out of sight. They vanish just as soon as they appear.

### POIs

### 1 - Diseased Campsite [Entrance]

**Ruin**: _Petrified Campsite_, _Overrun with unusual flora_ 

At the forest edge is a dead **campfire** with piles of dark gray **bedding** laid out close by. Plants, flowers, and other **flora** grow thickly over the campsite. A **trail** to the **North** leads into the forest. 

- **Campfire**: The remaining wood is stained a deep gray and very cold to the touch and as hard as iron.
- **Bedding**: Splinters of gray wood are stuck in the cloth.
  - Icy cold to the touch. The space beneath the cloth is partly blue and red, but gray circles grow out of the wood flecks. 
- **Flora**: Rare and unique species not common to these parts.
  - Skilled pruning and a few minutes of careful work produces a **Healing Salve** (restore 1d4 STR, 1 use).
- **Trail**: Long grooves in the rough shape of a tree trunk are cut into the ground. 
  - Fine spiderwebs block the forest entry, as if no one had walked through in a long while.

### 2 - Amber Grave

**Hazard**: _Sap Trap_, _Ghost Trapped in Crystal_

A rounded copse of vermilion **trees** surround a wide **puddle** of bubbling sap. A pointy green **object** is just visible in the center of the pool. 
 
- **Trees**: The base of each tree bleeds golden sap that runs into the puddle below. They do not appear to be diseased.
- **Puddle**: 12ft of sticky sap.
  - Ankle-high and extremely sticky. Irritates the skin.
- **Object**: Appears crystalline in nature.

- **Cabin**: There is a 3-in-6 chance that Dormin is here. Otherwise, he is out hunting.
- **Door**: A ring of white dust is sprinkled across the doorway.

Very austere, with only a simple **cot** and small dining **table**.
  
- **Cot**: Speckled with green moss and twigs. Smells faintly of rain.

- **Table**: On the table is a fully prepared meal of roast duck and root vegetables equal to a full meal for 2.

### 4 - Anglwyst's Chicken Hut

**Shelter**: _Hut With Legs_, _Hunting is Forbidden_

A cylindrical, chimneyed **hut** covered in thick **foliage** sits at the edge fo a small clearing. A wooden **sign** is pressed into the ground at the West entrance. A long spool of **chicken wire** is installed on the North side.

  - The door has no keyhole, but will only open to friends of Anglwyst (like Dormin). 
  - If the door is forced open or the hut is threatened, two legs will sprout from underneath and the hut will quickly retreat into the forest.
- **Foliage**: Both the roof and the windows are covered in thick leafy vines. 
  - None of the vines touch the ground, as they would be torn were hut to stand.

    - The barrel can fit up to one person, and is capable of flight (use the broom to "paddle" the air). 
  - **Stove**: Warm, and large enough to sleep on. A red scarf is tied around one of the iron handle.
    - The scarf belonged to Anglwyst, but is otherwise mundane. Dormin would love to have it.
  - **String**: Goods of rare and extinct quality. Worth 500gp to the right buyer. 
    - A mandrake root hangs from the string. If fed water daily it will openly declare a lie when it hears one. Scream loudly if cut.
