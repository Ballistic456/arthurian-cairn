# How Does Wilderness Exploration Work?

- A journey between two POIs, with _Easy_ terrain and on a _Trail_
- **Travel Distance**: 2 Watches in good weather.
- **Weather**: Raining. 

#### Watch One: 
  - Travel on a trail across a grassy plain. _The party did not get lost._
  - **Events Table**: **Sign**. One of the party members looks around after traversing a small hillock, and spies something glittering in the distance behind them. It disappears after a few seconds. Could that be a spyglass, reflecting in the sun?

#### Watch Two: 
- Travel continues on the same trail and plain. _The party did not get lost._
- **Events Table**: **Environment**. The weather has worsened in the evening, and as a result the plain is muddy and the trail harder to follow.  The party is forced to slow their march considerably, only reaching the the edge of the grasses at nightfall. They are forced to find shelter in the open plain rather than at their destination in the adjacent forest.

#### Watch Three: 
- Make Camp. The party sets up a hastily-made shelter and each member consumes a ration. A lookout rotation is set (there are four party members), and the other three go to sleep. 
- **Events Table**: **Sign**. The sky clears up enough for the first guard to see a light in the distance, flickering slowly. A campfire! Someone is definitely following them.
