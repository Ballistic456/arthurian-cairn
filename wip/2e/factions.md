# Factions Overview

Each region in your setting is dominated by one or more **Factions**, each with its own unique **Advantages**, **Goals**, and **Obstacles**. A Faction may be governed by a one or more powerful figures, but most of the time PCs will be dealing with subordinates known as Agents, tasked with helping complete a Faction's **Agenda**. Occasionally Agents will have personal motivations that differ from the Faction's main Agenda, a fact that canny PCs can exploit for their own gain. Place Agents in the **Heart** or otherwise appropriate location.

## Advantages

- Factions possess advantages that allow them to accomplish their goals, the culmination of which will result in fulfilling their Agendas.
- Advantages reflect a Faction's influence, materials, wealth, and unique features. Advantages are best interpreted through the lens of the Faction's Type.
- Factions add or lose advantages by trying to complete their agenda, leveraging their advantages as much as possible to achieve their goals, and at the same time work to acquire _more_ advantages. 

## Agendas

- All agendas have at least one obstacle that stands in the way of their completion. Additional obstacles can arise through Faction Actions (see below) or through developments in the fiction.
- Factions will work to complete their agendas independently, enlisting the help of PCs only when it helps strengthen their agenda.
- Agendas are accomplished through the completion of goals that work toward a clear objective or purpose. They are rooted in desire: that for power, wealth, revenge, resources, etc.
- Agendas should not be small things. Their successful completion should potentially change the landscape of a setting.

### Goals

- Each Faction should 3-4 [Goals](#goals) that _must_ be accomplished for this agenda to be accomplished.
- Goals are _progressive_, each building on the previous successes (or failures) of earlier goals.
- Most goals should focus on acquiring a distinct advantage in order to proceed to the next goal.
- At least one goal should deal with the Faction's primary obstacle. This may be the first goal, or the last.

## Agents

- Agents are often in charge of completing one or more of the goals of the Agenda of a Faction.
- Particularly large Factions may have additional Agents, often with each in charge of a different set of Resources
- Small Factions may have a single leader that acts as Agent, and may even be a Faction of one!

> The region map should reflect the impact of Factions as they work on completing their agendas and acquiring more advantages.
> Do not feel limited by the table results below. If something feels "off" or a different table result would work better for your setting, use it!

## Example Faction

### Type

- **Academics**: _Royal Cartographer's Guild_

### Advantages

- **Apparatus**: A _Map of the Dead_. It opens a path to the underworld, and to the secrets of the dead.  
- **Renown**: None would dare defy the _Guild_ publicly. Their voice carries great weight in the kingdom.
- **Agents**: _Dr. Horatia Confi_, first order. Discovered the _Map of the Dead_. Stats as human (WIL 15).  

### Agenda

The _Guild_ has long been at war with the _Holy Order of Yix_ (figuratively and otherwise) for over a century. It is time their ignorant sect was brought to its knees. _The Order_ is currently favored by the monarchy, but that could all change.
- Hire a skilled party, and lead them to the _Gates of the Underworld_. _Dr. Confi_ will lead the expedition.   
- Travel through the lands of the dead in search of the _Order_'s founder, and force their to reveal an ancient secret.
- Reveal the founder's secrets - including their true identity - to the monarchy. Tie up any loose ends, including witnesses.

### Obstacle

The _Guild_ has received legitimate intelligence that a well-placed operative moves within their ranks, and is aware of the coming operation.

## Faction Rules

- By default, **Factions** operate independent of the player character's actions. If the PCs do nothing, the **Factions** should still act to achieve their aims.
- Whenever a **Faction** is positioned to advance a **goal** in their **Agenda**, roll a **d12** on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table. 
- If two **Factions** are _opposed_, the **Faction** _most at risk_ makes a WIL save, using the score of its highest-ranking **Agent**. 
  - On a success, the **Faction** most at risk rolls on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, and their opponent does not.
  - On a fail, the **Faction** most at risk _does not_ roll on the [Faction Actions](#faction-actions) table, but their opponent does.

> The **Warden** should rely on the fiction to determine whether a **Faction** is positioned to advance their **Agenda**. **Goals** may be time-sensitive or depend on explicit circumstances. Other times it might be more appropriate after a major event, alliance, or friction between one or more **Factions**, etc.

### Faction Actions

|           |                   |                                                                |
| --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **d12**   | **Consequence**   | **Impact**                                                     |
| **1-2**   | **Failure**       | A new **Obstacle** is introduced, and a **Advantage** is lost. |
| **3-4**   | **Setback**       | An **Advantage** is lost.                                      |
| **5-6**   | **Status Quo**    | Nothing is gained, but nothing is lost.                        |
| **7-8**   | **Mixed Success** | A **goal** is achieved,  but an **Advantage** is lost.         |
| **9-10**  | **Success**       | A **goal** is achieved, and no **Advantages** are lost.        |
| **11-12** | **Major Success** | A **goal** is achieved, and a new **Advantage** is found.      |

> The actions of the PCs can always overrule the necessity for a **Faction** action, or in some cases shift the outcome of the roll in a favorable or unfavorable direction.
