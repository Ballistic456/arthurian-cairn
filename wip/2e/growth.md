# Growth

## Introduction

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, it is a character's unique experience in the game world that has the potential to alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, sometimes in undesirable ways! Keep in mind however that with some notable exceptions (such as _Scars_,) growth should always stem from a character's experiences in the game world. 

## Principles for Growth

- Growth is never arbitrary, but tied to a specific experience happening in the fiction.
- It is more important for a character to become more interesting than to become more skilled or capable.
- Characters experience growth not simply because they've gained a new experience but because that experience has effected them a significant way.
- Place opportunities for growth in as many places as possible.
- Characters grow as often during a play session as they do during Downtime.
- Growth should foster further interaction with the game world and its challenges.
- Growth is not a reward, but the logical result of a character's actions.
- Growth happens most often when a character interacts with something they do not understand, or something they were not _meant_ to understand.
- Characters may change in a way that they don't like, or may gain new abilities at a cost.
- Relics, treasure, factions, monsters, and important NPCs are all excellent potential triggers for growth.
- Characters can change slowly over time or by amassing significant, cumulative experiences around a single type of growth. 

## Triggers: a Framework for Growth

As characters engage with the game world, they must increasingly adapt to new realities in the fiction. Some of these adaptations are minor and rarely revisited again. Others are cumulative, representing a collection of related experiences. And some experiences are so powerful that their impact is immediate and unparalleled. For each of these it can be helpful to assign _Triggers_, or opportunities for growth. These represent significant turning points in a character's life, and should be met with a permanent and related change! The following examples represent an inexhaustive list: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Exposure to a powerful Relic
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Forging a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacting with something (or someone) they do not understand
- Overcoming a long-time woe or misdeed
- Success despite a limited talent or ability
- Failure despite a natural talent or ability
- Research or specialized training (typically during Downtime)
- Long-term exposure to a Spellbook or Relic 

### Examples

_After weeks of searching, Oxrable Kinter finally had cornered and defeated the serial murderer Tibor Heimshern. But instead of killing him, Ox used the Soul Extractor to pull the prone man's consciousness straight out of his body. Then to the surprise of everyone at the table, Ox proceeded to **drink the man's spirit.** The Warden called for a WIL save to overcome Tibor's powerful essence: a success! The Warden then asked the player to reroll Ox's Willpower attribute, saying he could keep the results if they were higher. And they were! However, the Warden also ruled that if at any point Ox had another enemy weak and at his mercy, a WIL save would be required to overcome the murderer's dormant tendencies._

## Downtime & Growth

Downtime procedures are a great way for PCs to focus on training, specialization, research, or faction relationships.


### Old Stuff

Madrigal (a Fungal Forager) has finally found the source of a nearby village's bellowing sickness: a Liverbracket infestation at the bottom of the town's well. After uprooting the fungi, he decided to keep a sample for his future endeavors. He then embarked on a ten-day journey across the Randana Lava Flats in search of a potential Gate to the Roots he'd read about while researching methods to remove this unique fungal growth. The existence of this sample had slipped his mind until many weeks later when he noticed a strange discoloration on his canteen. He was then forced to cut the canteen open, discovering that not only had the fungus spread into his water supply but that he'd been drinking the tainted water for some days. Strangely he'd been unaffected by the strange visions and less-comfortable side-effects common to ingesting the fungus, likely because the effects were being counteracted by his daily intake of Clustermelon Flower, a potent form of heat resistance needed to cross the Lava Flats. He spent a Watch rebuilding his canteen, then set out again.

Three weeks later, Madrigal noticed series of small bumps on his skin, along with a familiar discoloration.
