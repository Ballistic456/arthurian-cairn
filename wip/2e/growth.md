# Growth

## Introduction

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, it is a character's unique experience in the game world that has the potential to alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, sometimes in undesirable ways! Keep in mind however that with some notable exceptions (such as _Scars_,) growth should always stem from a character's experiences in the game world. 

## Principles for Growth

- Growth is never arbitrary, but tied to a specific experience happening in the fiction.
- It is more important for a character to become more interesting than to become more skilled or capable.
- Characters experience growth not simply because they've gained a new experience but because that experience has effected them a significant way.
- Place opportunities for growth in as many places as possible.
- Characters grow as often during a play session as they do during Downtime.
- Growth should foster further interaction with the game world and its challenges.
- Growth is not a reward, but the logical result of a character's actions.
- Growth happens most often when a character interacts with something they do not understand, or something they were not _meant_ to understand.
- Characters may change in a way that they don't like, or may gain new abilities at a cost.
- Relics, treasure, factions, monsters, and important NPCs are all excellent potential triggers for growth.
- Characters can change slowly over time or by amassing significant, cumulative experiences around a single type of growth. 

## Triggers: a Framework for Growth

As characters engage with the game world, they must increasingly adapt to new realities in the fiction. Some of these adaptations are minor and rarely revisited again. Others are cumulative, representing a collection of related experiences. And some experiences are so powerful that their impact is immediate and unparalleled. For each of these it can be helpful to assign _Triggers_, or opportunities for growth. These represent significant turning points in a character's life, and should be met with a permanent and related change! The following examples represent an inexhaustive list: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Exposure to a powerful Relic
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Forging a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacting with something (or someone) they do not understand
- Overcoming a long-time woe or misdeed
- Success despite a limited talent or ability
- Failure despite a natural talent or ability
- Research or specialized training (typically during Downtime)
- Long-term exposure to a Spellbook or Relic 

### Examples


## Downtime & Growth

Downtime procedures are a great way for PCs to focus on training, specialization, research, or faction relationships.
