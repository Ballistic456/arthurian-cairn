# Growth

## Introduction

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their successes, or their failures. Nor do PCs gain experience from killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, a PC's experiences in the game world can alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, sometimes in undesirable ways! Keep in mind however that aside from _Scars_, growth should stem from a character's experiences in the game world. 

## Principles for Growth

- Growth is never arbitrary, but tied to a _specific_ experience happening in the fiction.
- It is more important for a PC to grow more _interesting_ than more skilled, or capable.
- PCs experience growth not just because they've gained more skill and experience, but because that experience has effected them a significant way.
- Place opportunities for growth in as many places as possible.
- Growth occurs _during play_ as often as during Downtime.
- Growth should foster further interaction with the game world and its challenges.
- Growth is not a _reward_, but the logical result of a character's action.
- Growth often happens when a character interacts with something they do not understand. 

## Downtime & Growth

Downtime procedures are a great way for PCs to focus on training or specialization.

## Triggers 

There are many potential triggers for growth. The following is an inexhaustive list: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Exposure to a powerful Relic
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Changed a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacted with something dangerous, and felt its punishment
- Overcame a long-time woe
- Succeeded or failed despite a natural talent or ability


### Older Examples

- Two days of study under a former royal archer has taught you how to fire arrows more effectively. Attacks with a longbow are enhanced.
- After two weeks' of daily practice with the _Blade of Gwoed_, you feel confident enough to use the deadly weapon in combat. Critical Damage: target loses a limb or is disemboweled (your choice).
- Three days' worth of study under the tutelage of a skilled warrior has taught you how to never be surprised. You no longer need to make a DEX save before combat (unless the Warden says otherwise).
- Five nights of intense study with the _Book of Curses_ has given you an edge in battle. If you insult an opponent before combat, all of their attacks against you and your friends are impaired.
- After training with the _Mourning Monks of Es'ta_, you can now speak with the dead. You are deprived afterwards.
