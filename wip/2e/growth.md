# Growth

## Introduction

Unlike other roleplaying games, Cairn does not reward player characters for their killing monsters, looting treasure, or exploring new places. Instead, it is a character's unique experience in the game world that has the potential to alter their health, abilities, beliefs, bonds, and even their minds.

Just as the in-game world continues to grow and change, so do the player characters. The events, experiences, and encounters of a play session can greatly impact a PC, sometimes in undesirable ways! Keep in mind however that with some notable exceptions (such as _Scars_,) growth should always stem from a character's experiences in the game world. 

## Principles for Growth

- Growth is never arbitrary, but tied to a specific experience happening in the fiction.
- It is more important for a character to become more interesting than to become more skilled or capable.
- Characters experience growth not simply because they've gained a new experience but because that experience has effected them a significant way.
- Place opportunities for growth in as many places as possible.
- Characters grow as often during a play session as they do during Downtime.
- Growth should foster further interaction with the game world and its challenges.
- Growth is not a reward, but the logical result of a character's actions.
- Growth happens most often when a character interacts with something they do not understand, or something they were not _meant_ to understand.
- Characters may change in a way that they don't like, or may gain new abilities at a cost.
- Relics, treasure, factions, monsters, and important NPCs are all excellent potential triggers for growth.
- Characters can change slowly over time or by amassing significant, cumulative experiences around a single type of growth. 

## Triggers: a Framework for Growth

As characters engage with the game world, they are increasingly forced to change and adapt to the new realities in the fiction. Some of these adaptations are minor and rarely revisited again. Others are cumulative, representing a collection of related experiences. And some experiences are so powerful that their impact is immediate and unparalleled. For each of these it can be helpful to assign _Triggers_, or opportunities for growth. These represent significant turning points or inflections in a character's life, and should be met with a permanent and related change! There are many potential triggers for growth. The following is an inexhaustive list: 

- Injury or contamination by a powerful entity
- Exposure to a powerful Relic
- Advancement within a Faction
- Resolution of a Bond or Omen
- Forging a relationship with a being of great power
- Interacting with something (someone) they do not understand
- Overcoming a long-time woe
- Success despite a limited talent or ability
- Failure despite a natural talent or ability
- Research or specialized training (typically during Downtime) 

### Finding Triggers



## Downtime & Growth

Downtime procedures are a great way for PCs to focus on training or specialization.

### Older Examples

- Two days of study under a former royal archer has taught you how to fire arrows more effectively. Attacks with a longbow are enhanced.
- After two weeks' of daily practice with the _Blade of Gwoed_, you feel confident enough to use the deadly weapon in combat. Critical Damage: target loses a limb or is disemboweled (your choice).
- Three days' worth of study under the tutelage of a skilled warrior has taught you how to never be surprised. You no longer need to make a DEX save before combat (unless the Warden says otherwise).
- Five nights of intense study with the _Book of Curses_ has given you an edge in battle. If you insult an opponent before combat, all of their attacks against you and your friends are impaired.
- After training with the _Mourning Monks of Es'ta_, you can now speak with the dead. You are deprived afterwards.
