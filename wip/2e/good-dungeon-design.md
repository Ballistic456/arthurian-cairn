# Good Dungeon Design

## Principles of Good Dungeon Design

### Entrances/Exits

  - Have multiple entrances and exits.
  - Add meaningful information to doorways.
  
### Purpose
  - Determine the original purpose of the dungeon.
  - Consider its age and current use.
  - Identify what it was designed to keep out.
  
### Levels
  - Include various levels to represent danger gradation.
  - Introduce an element of risk and reward.
  
### Layout
  - Incorporate loops for non-linear exploration.
  - Avoid tree-like structures and dead ends.
  - Design a network of interconnected rooms and corridors.

### Verticality
  - Add vertical spaces, tall rooms, and climbable structures.
  - Include features that challenge and excite players, such as mineshafts.
  
### Secret Areas:
  - Design hidden zones for players to discover.
  - Provide subtle clues indicating secrets.
  
### Room Varieties:

  - Vary room shapes, sizes, and functions.
  - Use architectural motifs to connect rooms thematically.
  
### Tactical Areas:
  - Include zones that offer strategic advantages.
  - Design chokepoints, elevated spots, and other tactical features.
  
### Spying Opportunities:
  - Provide means for players to gather information discreetly.

## Dungeon Checklist

### Treasure:
  - Ensure there's something valuable to seek.
  - Offer diverse forms of treasure, including knowledge, allies, trade goods, and artifacts.
  - Infuse narrative elements into the treasure.
  
### Challenges:
  - Incorporate threats and adversaries.
  - Use monsters and obstacles to tell the dungeon's story.
  
### Danger:
  - Create a sense of peril without making it unbeatable.
  - Label overtly dangerous areas and creatures.
  - Ensure nearly all combats can be avoided or escaped from.
  
### Paths:
  - Offer multiple routes for diverse experiences.
  - Enable player agency and allow for dungeon mastery.
  - Balance between branching paths and necessary linearity.
  
### Interaction:
  - Include NPCs or creatures for players to engage with.
  - Use NPCs to deepen the dungeon's narrative and offer role-playing opportunities.
