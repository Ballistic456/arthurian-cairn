# How Does Variable Difficulty Work?

## Introduction

Cairn lacks Attribute modifiers, advantage, and disadvantage. This designs emphasizes one of the game's core conceits, that play should focus on narrative, in-world experiences rather than some mechanical distinction. Player characters pursue advantages through critical thinking and problem solving, not by stacking together external mechanics! As a result, preparing situations for variable difficulty can sometimes feel opaque, or difficult to achieve.

The following principles and examples may provide some structure:

## Principles for Variable Difficulty 

- Be open with players about challenges. This doesn't mean revealing all of the world's secrets, but provide each player with the maximum information their character might have.
- Avoid requiring a dice roll whenever possible. If a PC can solve a problem using purely narrative components, _do not ask for a roll_.
- Create situations that emphasize non-mechanical solution. A problem is more interesting when key to solving it can be understood purely within the fiction. 
- Reward thinking outside the box. This may be a simple mitigation of risk, a new piece of knowledge, character Growth, and more.
- Replace multiple dice rolls with a single dice throw. The fewer mechanics involved in a solution, the better. 
- Extend positive outcomes according to effort. If the PCs worked really hard to make something succeed despite the danger, enhance the result to match their trouble.
- Fictional consequences should triumph over purely mechanical effects. Results that exist purely within the rules are usually hollow, and lack the potential of any in-world impact.
- The outcome of a Save need not be a simple binary. You can tailor the results based on the totality of input: the effort, forethought, resources, and skill that went into the roll.
- Feel free to say "no," but always offer an alternative. If the party cannot proceed due to circumstances beyond their control, give them another option to consider.
- Death should always be a choice. If the risk is so great that the outcome might be fatal, make sure the player understands what they're getting into.
- In order for agency to exist, there _must_ be multiple viable options that the PCs can choose from. The more choices, the more interesting the situation becomes.
- Many dangers can be mitigated or extinguished given time, effort, and skill. If there is no real risk, just skip the roll!
