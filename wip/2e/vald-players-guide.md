# Vald (Player's Guide)

## Introduction

The implied setting of Cairn is called _Vald_, encompassing all developed or settled lands, cities, towns, forests, etc. The specific ruler is irrelevant, as most adventures will take place in smaller towns and villages, the forest, and the margins of the realm. Most inhabitants (regardless of region) refer to the local centers of power as the _Cities_, occasionally as a pejorative.

Most towns and villages are built within a day's walk of one another, near sources of water and lumber. Larger villages try to be self-sufficient but may still rely on nearby farms and local hunters for food. Most settlements were originally organized around a specific industry such as lumber, brewing, fishing, or mining, and often a Fieldwarden or Beast Handler is posted to protect a community's most valuable assets.

Larger towns will elect a Reeve responsible for the community's well-being, paying tithes, and resolving disagreements. In the event of a crime or violence, a constable is empowered to enforce the local laws. Taverns and inns are common in villages close to trade routes, while large settlements often boast at least one temple or shrine.   

Established trails between larger towns are fairly common, while maintained roads are almost non-existent except to the distant cities, and itinerant merchants, Kettlewrights, and various peddlers pass through on a semi-regular basis. Outriders are often hired to protect and escort larger caravans through open plains and cut forests, while in the Riverlands, the Rill Runners help ferry passengers between high marshes on winding rivers.

Even the smallest village may play host to scholarly types from the cities: a Scrivener, Aurifex, or Greenwise with keen interest in nearby tombs, barrows, and Gates. Often a Bonekeeper or Fungal Forager will be hired for their expertise, while clever adventurers will ensure that a Barber-Surgeon is never far away, or a Cutpurse if there is unsavory business that needs tending to. Of course, Mountebanks and Jongleurs often accompany these sorts, riding their coattails in hopes that they too will benefit from the next major discovery.

Those who enter the Wood hire a guide familiar with the territory, such as a Prowler or Fletchwind, while the truly determined traveler will seek the wisdom of a Half Witch or Foundling with some connection to its darker secrets. Closer to the border, the Marchguard work to keep the realm free of outside influence, while the Hexenbane seek to protect it from forces within.

## The Wood

The _Wood_ surrounds and divides the realm, including anyone or anything that does not swear fealty to the current regime. Denizens of the Wood are fiercely independent, believing they are subject solely to its rules. Its various peoples, creatures, and unrelenting natural elements have kept the outside world at bay since time immemorial. The Wood is the spirit of all forests, and they in turn are its flesh, and the life they support a sign of its health.

At the core of each forest is a _Heart Tree_, and the place where the forest is at its most powerful as well as its most dangerous. Each Heart Tree is born from a single _Heartseed_, acquired exclusively from a Heart Tree that is dying or dead. The Heart Tree acts as a pinion to the plants, trees, and animals all around it, observing and reacting to any problematic incursions into its domain. In particular, Heart Trees _fear humans_.

Forests never live in isolation, and will communicate with one another to give warning or ask for help. Aid can come in many forms, as the Heartseed has great reach. Raven Folk defenders may lay sap traps to capture stray hunters, while Dryads steal the hatchet from the lumberjack's toolbox. But none are more powerful (nor feared) than the Woodwose, the forest's true protector. A creature wrought from both plant and bone, the Woodwose lives for only one purpose: to protect the forest and any that live within its boundaries.

Despite its fearsome reputation, many tell tales of the wood's kindness as well. Green, muscular arms saving a child caught by a sudden rock slide. Will-o-Wisps revealing a hidden path once thought lost. Words of warning sung from a crow on a tree. And so, rangers and other outsiders will leave bowls of fruit and nuts alongside great rock piles as proof of their respect and admiration, in the hopes that they will be allowed to pass freely through a protected Wood.

Of course, the Wood is not empty of people. Hidden in the boughs and in empty glades are populated villages, rustic cabins, and the odd tower. Those who can survive (or even thrive) in such places learn to live according to the rules of the forest, for those that ignore or foolishly oppose these rules often meet grisly ends. The Wood is populated by creatures strange and wondrous, such as Goblins, Spirits, Treants, Trolls, Werewolves, Witches, and even talking plants and animals. Most are openly hostile to outsiders (particularly humans), but others will (on occasion) parley with those that have shown respect for the Wood. Of course, all demonstrate utter respect for the Fae (sometimes called the Pale Folk, or the _Neighbors_).

## The Roots

The _Roots_ is a realm of mystery and horror underground, indifferent to the arbitrary divisions of the aboveground civilizations. Below, labyrinthine hollows stretch for immeasurable distances, connecting humble town sewers to far-flung ruins beyond the borders. Only the brave or foolish dare enter the Roots in search of forgotten Relics or profound wealth, and the few that do return whisper of the indescribable horrors and evil intelligence guarding these lost treasures. Stories tell of adventurers lost for centuries in the depths, only to emerge claiming that just a few hours have passed. Others claim to have made a week-long journey above ground in just one day, traveling through the tunnels beneath.

Entrances to the Roots, known as _Gates_, are scattered across the lands and are usually hidden or protected by powerful forces. Further, Gates cannot be opened without a proper key or alchemical pattern, and once opened, _can never be shut again._ Folk histories recount their openings as omens of great misfortunes, where creatures more vile than the darkest nightmare slink through, devouring nearby homes and villages. Others tell of great heroes raising their swords against these terrors, sealing away the Gate beneath rubble, mountains, lakes, or other impenetrable barriers.

What _is_ known is that the Roots are made of vast underground caves as large as an emptied ocean, without even a hint of sunlight. A variety of fungal growths provide weak light in some places, as do various minerals and strange, shallow pits of blue flame. Very little is known about these pits other than that they are tended to by terrible three-eyed Ogres who thirst for blood as if it were the sweetest wine. The various creatures and wild animals that survive in such harsh conditions have developed natural means to live in utter darkness, adapting their eyesight to function in even the dimmest light or eschewing vision altogether.

Of the various peoples and tribes, it is said they speak a harsh, guttural speech, sprinkled with familiar words and phrases. Their warriors carry weapons that spin of their own volition, glowing brighter with each rotation. When the blades are finally released, their heated edges can split flesh and even rock with deadly ease. To date, no one has successfully parlayed with the _People Who Live Below_. Some contend that there are bustling towns, cities, and even great palaces in the Roots! Of course, few scholars believe them, and those that do have been ostracized into obscurity by their peers. Still, explorers cannot deny the ancient husks of impressive architecture found throughout the Roots, the ancient cities and enormous ships of an unimaginable world. Hazy reports claim that one such ruin, a gargantuan ziggurat boasting hundreds of levels, still flickers with light and life. These rumors have yet to be substantiated.

Today, most know to avoid any mention of Gates, or keys, or related alchemy. But of course, there are always those that cannot resist its draw...
