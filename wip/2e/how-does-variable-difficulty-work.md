# How Does Variable Difficulty Work?

## Introduction

Cairn lacks mechanics such as Attribute modifiers, Advantage and Disadvantage, and so on. This design emphasizes one of the game's core conceits: that play should focus on narrative, in-world experiences over mechanical resolutions. Player characters are encouraged to pursue advantages through critical thinking and problem-solving, not by stacking together external mechanics! As a result, preparing situations for variable difficulty can sometimes feel opaque or even difficult to achieve. The following principles and examples may provide some structure:

## Principles for Variable Difficulty 

- Create situations that emphasize non-mechanical solutions. A problem is more interesting when the key to solving it can be understood purely within the fiction. 
- Reward thinking outside the box. This may be a simple mitigation of risk, a new piece of knowledge, character growth, and more.
- Extend positive outcomes according to effort. If the PCs worked really hard to make something succeed despite the danger, enhance the result to match their trouble.
- Emphasize fictional consequences rather than mechanical buffs. Purely mechanical rewards are usually hollow and lack the potential of in-world benefits.
- Many dangers can be mitigated or extinguished given time, effort, and skill. If there is no real risk, just skip the roll!

## Stacking the Odds: The Environment

> Freya is facing off against a Wood Troll after being separated from the rest of the party. Pinned between the creature and a cave wall, she has no choice but to engage in direct combat. She has already passed her initial DEX save and thus gets to attack before her opponent.

**Freya**: _"I know I can't beat this guy fair and square, so I'd like to know if there is anything nearby that might even the odds a bit. I grew up on the streets, which means I know how to fight dirty. I'd like to try and blind him without getting clobbered in the process. What are my options?"_

**Warden**: _"I'll roll a Die of Fate to see how dusty things are around here. A 4! Alright, there is definitely some dust between you and your opponent, but you might need to get close to him in order to scoop some up. You'll need to make a DEX save."_ 

> Freya rolls a 13: a success!

**Warden**: _"You grab a fistful of dust off the ground in front of you and toss it straight into your opponent's face. He staggers backward and appears unable to defend himself as he fights to clear the grit from his eyes!"_

> The Wood Troll loses a turn as he tries to remove the dust from his face. Until he succeeds, he also has only 0 HP.

**Freya**: _"I know I should run for it... but I can't help but take advantage of this situation. I'd like to introduce this fellow to the Twins."_

> Freya rolls d6+d6 for her daggers, dealing 5 damage directly to the Wood Troll's STR Attribute.

**Warden**: _"You stab him with both blades, green blood gushing from open wounds as the creature roars out in anger. Let's see if it survives the attack! Oooh, it fails its STR save and takes **Critical Damage**! It's down!"_

**Freya**: _"Alright, I'm taking this as a sign. Time to make my exit!"_

> Freya flees the scene (no DEX save required), leaving the Wood Troll to bleed out, or so she thought...

## Stacking the Odds: Gear

> Wolfram, Lucius, and Freya are investigating rumors of an invisible creature that has been attacking locals in the Wood. They've tracked the creature to its island den just 40ft from the shoreline of a poison lake. The lake is separated from the surrounding forest by heavy mud flats.

**Warden**: _"The creature's footprints end at the shore of a roiling lake that bubbles and swirls violently. Knowing the history of the region, you realize that if the lake water doesn't kill you, the toxic fumes stemming from its surface definitely will!"_

**Wolfram**: _"We know that the blasted thing makes its home on that pile of rocks out there. Obviously we can't swim across, but I have an idea about how we might draw it out! Lucius, I'm sorry but of the three of us, you're the most... soft. In other words, the perfect bait! Let's make it seem as if your cart is stuck in the mud. I've had a blanket rolled up in my blanket for a while now, perhaps Freya and I can hide under it, then pounce on the creature at just the right moment?"_

**Lucius**: _"I knew I shouldn't have worn my fancy hat today! Fine, let's proceed."_

**Warden**: _"The party executes their plan as described, creating the perfect bait for their unsuspecting quarry. I'm going to roll a Die of Fate to determine whether the creature even takes notice... a 5! Alright, that means that the creature definitely wants to investigate the situation, but there's a wrinkle as well: it's starting to get dark."_

**Freya**: _"Presumably this means that Wolfram and I are able to spy on the island while we hide, right? And that Lucius is still looking the opposite way, pretending to fuss over a stuck wheel?"_

**Warden**: _"Correct. Both Wolfram and Freya can still see through the cart slats that something clambered out from beneath the pile of rocks on the island, scattering them as it moves towards the water. You can't actually tell what moved the rocks, though. It really is invisible! As you watch, something slips into the toxic waters, making a quiet splash. Based on the ripples on the surface, it appears to be heading in your direction!"_

**Wolfram**: _"Well I guess this is as good a time as ever to bring out my Voidglass Shard! It lets me see invisible creatures, but packs a wallop! I won't be able to see out of one eye for an hour, during which time my fighting skills will be... less effective. Might I be able to get a shot with the crossbow while looking through the glass?"_

**Warden**: _"You need two hands for the crossbow."_

**Freya**: _"I can hold the Voidglass Shard up to his eye."_

**Warden**: _"That will work, but you won't have an action of your own until after the creature has a chance to react."_

**Lucius**: _"Um, what about me? I won't be able to see the creature at all, let alone defend myself! I'd like to prepare an action for the moment Wolfram gets a shot off. I still have the large sack from our last caper, I wonder if I could leap on the creature when it approaches, trapping it like a giant fish?"_

**Warden**: _"That works! You each prepare yourselves for what is to come. Freya and Wolfram, you wait in silence and the ripples come ever closer. Finally, they stop! Freya places the Voidglass Shard on Wolfram's eye as he raises his crossbow. Wolfram, you see a slimy, fish-like creature climbing out of the water, yellowed scales crisscrossing its multi-limbed body. There is a brief, breathless pause and then a loud TWANG as he lets loose a crossbow bolt."_

> Wolfram rolls a d8, resulting in a 6! As the creature was unaware of its attackers, the damage goes directly to STR. It makes a Critical Damage save, and the result is a 3: a success. 

**Warden**: _"The creature is impaled by the bolt, green fluid spurting out of its body. Where it lands, the surface hisses as if in contact with acid. It turns towards the cart, but before it can react Lucius throws his large sack over it. The creature thrashes about inside the sack, twisting in every which way."_

> The Warden makes a DEX save for the creature to see if it can quickly break free from the sack. Out of water, it has only 8 DEX. It rolls a 12: a fail. Unable to defend itself, the creature is quickly tied up and placed in the cart, along with a jar of the toxic water for the journey. Working together, the party quickly heads back towards town.
