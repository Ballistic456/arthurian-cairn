# How Does Variable Difficulty Work?

## Introduction

In Cairn, players are encouraged to overcome problems by asking questions, thinking critically, and working within the fiction of the game world to curry advantage. The following principles and examples should help Wardens create rulings consistent and fair rulings that both challenge and reward players for their effort.   

## Principles For Variable Difficulty 

- Reward thinking outside the box. This may be a simple mitigation of risk, a new piece of knowledge, character growth, and more.
- Modify outcomes according to the effort that went into them. If the PCs worked really hard to make something succeed despite the danger involved, enhance the result to match their trouble.
- Emphasize fictional consequences rather than mechanical buffs. Purely mechanical rewards are usually hollow and lack the potential of in-world benefits.
- Many dangers can be mitigated or extinguished given time, effort, and skill. If there is no real risk, just skip the roll!
- Create situations that emphasize non-mechanical solutions. A problem is more interesting when the key to solving it can be understood purely within the fiction.

## Examples

### Evening The Odds

> Freya is facing off against a Wood Troll after being separated from the rest of the party. Pinned between the creature and a cave wall, she has no choice but to engage in direct combat. She has already passed her initial DEX save and thus gets to attack before her opponent.

**Freya**: _"I know I can't beat this guy fair and square, so I'd like to know if there is anything nearby that might even the odds a bit. I grew up on the streets, which means I know how to fight dirty. I'd like to try and blind him without getting clobbered in the process. What are my options?"_

**Warden**: _"I'll roll a Die of Fate to see how dusty things are around here. A 4! Alright, there is definitely some dust between you and your opponent, but you might need to get close to him in order to scoop some up. You'll need to make a DEX save."_ 

> Freya rolls a 13: a success!

**Warden**: _"You grab a fistful of dust off the ground in front of you and toss it straight into your opponent's face. He staggers backward and is unable to defend himself as he fights to clear the grit from his eyes!"_

> The Wood Troll loses a turn as he tries to remove the dust from his face. Until he succeeds, he also has only 0 HP.

**Freya**: _"I know I should run for it... but I can't help but take advantage of this situation. I'd like to introduce this fellow to the Twins."_

> Freya rolls d6+d6 for her daggers (a 3 and a 5), dealing 5 damage directly to the Wood Troll's STR Attribute. The Warden then makes a Critical Damage save for the Troll, rolling a 19: a fail!

**Warden**: _"You stab him with both blades, green blood gushing from open wounds as the creature roars out in anger. Let's see if it survives the attack! Oooh, it fails its STR save and takes **Critical Damage**! It's down!"_

**Freya**: _"Alright, I'm taking this as a sign. Time to make my exit!"_

> Freya flees the scene (no DEX save required), leaving the Wood Troll to bleed out. If she had known that it can slowly regenerate its health, she might have stayed...

### Teamwork

> Wolfram, Lucius, and Freya are investigating rumors of an invisible creature that has been attacking locals in the Wood. They've tracked the creature to its island den just 40ft from the shoreline of a poison lake. The lake is separated from the surrounding forest by heavy mud flats.

**Warden**: _"The creature's footprints end at the shore of a roiling lake that bubbles and swirls violently. Knowing the history of the region, you realize that if the lake water doesn't kill you, the toxic fumes stemming from its surface definitely will!"_

**Wolfram**: _"We know that the blasted thing makes its home on that pile of rocks out there. Obviously we can't swim across, but I have an idea about how we might draw it out! Lucius, I'm sorry but of the three of us, you're the most... soft. In other words, the perfect bait! Let's make it seem as if your cart is stuck in the mud. I've had a blanket rolled up in my pack for a while now, perhaps Freya and I can hide under it, then pounce on the creature at just the right moment?"_

**Lucius**: _"I knew I shouldn't have sported my fancy hat today! Fine, let's proceed."_

**Warden**: _"The party executes their plan as described, creating the perfect bait for their unsuspecting quarry. I'm going to roll a Die of Fate to determine whether the creature even takes notice... a 5! Alright, that means that the creature definitely wants to investigate the situation, but there's a wrinkle as well: it's starting to get dark."_

**Freya**: _"Presumably this means that Wolfram and I are able to spy on the island while we hide, right? And that Lucius is still looking the opposite way, pretending to fuss over a stuck wheel?"_

**Warden**: _"Correct. Both Wolfram and Freya can still see through the cart slats that something clambered out from beneath the pile of rocks on the island, scattering them as it moves towards the water. You can't actually tell what moved the rocks, though. It really is invisible! As you watch, something slips into the toxic waters, making a quiet splash. Based on the ripples on the surface, it appears to be heading in your direction!"_

**Wolfram**: _"Well I guess this is as good a time as ever to bring out my Voidglass Shard! It lets me see invisible creatures, but packs a wallop! I won't be able to see out of one eye for an hour, during which time my fighting skills will be... less effective. Might I be able to get a shot with the crossbow while looking through the glass?"_

**Warden**: _"You need two hands for the crossbow."_

**Freya**: _"I can hold the Voidglass Shard up to his eye."_

**Warden**: _"That will work, but you won't have an action of your own until after the creature has a chance to react."_

**Lucius**: _"Um, what about me? I won't be able to see the creature at all, let alone defend myself! I'd like to prepare an action for the moment Wolfram gets a shot off. I still have the large sack from our last caper, I wonder if I could leap on the creature when it approaches, trapping it like a giant fish?"_

**Warden**: _"That works! You each prepare yourselves for what is to come. Freya and Wolfram, you wait in silence and the ripples come ever closer. Finally, they stop! Freya places the Voidglass Shard on Wolfram's eye as he raises his crossbow. Wolfram, you see a slimy, fish-like creature climbing out of the water, yellowed scales crisscrossing its multi-limbed body. There is a brief, breathless pause and then a loud TWANG as he lets loose a crossbow bolt."_

> Wolfram rolls a d8, resulting in a 6! As the creature was unaware of its attackers, the damage goes directly to STR. It makes a Critical Damage save, and the result is a 3: a success. 

**Warden**: _"The creature is impaled by the bolt, green fluid spurting out of its body. Where it lands, the surface hisses as if in contact with acid. It turns towards the cart, but before it can react Lucius throws his large sack over it. The creature thrashes about inside the sack, twisting in every which way."_

> The Warden makes a DEX save for the creature to see if it can quickly break free from the sack. Out of water, it has only 8 DEX. It rolls a 12: a fail. Unable to defend itself, the creature is quickly tied up and placed in the cart, along with a jar of the toxic water for the journey. Working together, the party quickly heads back towards town.

### Character History

> The party are escorting an agent of the Alsace faction deep in enemy territory. Their destination is hidden in a small village protected by tall wooden walls. Their job is to sneak their client into the heavily guarded town, and then into the ancient vault of Der Thunn. As they approach the village, the sun is just beginning to set, and Lucius has been sent ahead to investigate, posing as a troubadour from the South.

**Warden**: _"You approach the walled village, following the dirt trail that leads directly to the town's front gate. Two guards stand on either side of the gate, which is closed. The guards are nearly identical save for a weak mustache sported by one."_

**Lucius**: _"Ho there fine gentlemen! May one such as myself inquire as to whether entry to your village would be permissible on this fine evening? I've had a long journey but am flush with gold and would love to spread some of my good luck!"_

**Warden**: _"The men exchange a look. The mustachioed guard replies, 'No entry after dark. That's the rule.'"_

> At this point, Lucius is putting on all his charm, and essentially trying to bribe the guards to gain entry. He is also the most at risk in this situation, as the two men are well-equipped to handle a lone traveler, and have backup besides. If it were required Lucius would make the WIL save and not the guards.

**Lucius**: _"Yes, I understand. But it isn't quite dark yet, is it? The Sun is only just setting. May I please enter? I'd happily start sharing my newfound wealth with you two first, if you catch my drift. Perhaps I could bring you each a well-earned beer? To show my appreciation, of course._"

**Warden**: _"The two men exchange looks once more, but this time the other man replies, smirking. 'Well... perhaps this once. The Sun hasn't truly set just yet. And we are quite thirsty, after all.'"_

> The Warden made a ruling based on what was known about these men: they were simple village guards, they'd been working a long day, and they loved beer. Perhaps with another character this wouldn't have worked, but Lucius is a Mountebank and his capacity for winning the confidence of his targets has been well established. The risk is minimal, so the guards let him in. 

### Greater Risk For Greater Reward 

> The party has sent Freya under the cover of darkness to spy on an enemy encampment. Her goal is to ascertain their enemy's total number as well as what sort of dangers might await there.

**Warden**: _"Halfway to the camp you see a light flickering along the trail. Someone is coming toward you! What do you do?"_

**Freya**: _"I slip into the foliage on the side of the trail, keeping as quiet as possible. Does that require a save?"_

**Warden**: _"No, because you've got enough of a distance from this person and you don't have any light sources lit. You may hide without risk of being found."_

**Freya**: _"Hmm, that gives me an idea. If it seems to me like this person might belong to the same faction as our enemy, I would like to ambush them and steal their clothes. I don't want to spill much blood or raise the alarm, so my blades will need to be fast and furious."_

**Warden**: _"OK. They will need to make a DEX save to react in time to fend off your attack, then. It might not go as cleanly as you hope!"_

**Freya**: _"What if instead I just knock them unconscious by dropping a tree branch on top of them? I have a hand ax in here somewhere."_

**Warden**: _"That might work. You'll need to sprint back a bit, climb a tree and then save STR to determine if you can cut the branch down at just the right moment, without notifying your target. If you fail, you will come down with the branch as well, potentially taking damage and putting yourself in a very vulnerable position."_

> Freya rushes back down the trail, climbs a tree and begins hacking at one of the branches with her ax. She rolls a STR save: a 7, a success! She thwacks the branch at just the right moment and it falls atop the lone traveler below her, knocking them unconscious. Freya steals their clothes and their torch, then sets off down the trail towards the camp.
