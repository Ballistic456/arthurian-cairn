|       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Your "patients" kept reporting miraculous recoveries, despite your lack of training. Start with **Bandages** (3 uses) and a _knack for healing_.                                                                                                                              |
| **2** | After seducing a wealthy patron, their family hired a criminal gang to retrieve you. You escaped but need to lay low for a while. Start with a **Scroll** of _Charm_ (_petty_).                                                                                                  |
| **3** | You were a peddler of fake prophesies, but when one turned out to be true, it drew unwanted attention. Roll on the **Omens** table, but keep the result to yourself. Start with a **Knife** (d6) hidden in your boot.                                                  |
| **4** | Your latest stunt destroyed a priceless artifact and injured a dozen bystanders. Start with a **Captain's Uniform** (_petty_), a **Ceremonial Sword** (harmless, _bulky_, 60gp), and a **Bouquet of Flowers**.                                                     |
| **5** | You were cursed by a hedgewitch for fooling some innocent village folk. Magic acts unpredictably in your hands (_WIL save to avoid disaster_). If you are the target of magic, the same applies to its wielder.                                                       |
| **6** | Your "seances" with the dead were in actuality a ruse involving a cleverly hidden spellbook of [Auditory Illusion](https://cairnrpg.com/cairn-srd/#100-spells). Inevitably, a patron discovered your secret. Start with the **Spellbook** and a bundle of scarves. |

## What keepsake could always identify you? Roll 1d6:

|       |                       |                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Royal Crest**       | Born into royalty, you chose a different life. The crest grants you access, but also alerts your family of your whereabouts.                                          |
| **2** | **Pop's Miracle Oil** | A smelly concoction that is also very, very, slippery. 2 uses.                                                                                                        |
| **3** | **Surgeon's Soap**    | A lye and ash block that makes skin temporarily transparent, revealing the anatomy within. 4 uses.                                                                    |
| **4** | **Goat Powder**       | Derived from the placenta of a baby goat.  Temporarily cures any affliction, but symptoms return within hours. 2 Uses.                                                        |
| **5** | **Cursed Sapphire**   | Valued at around **200gp**, it _noticeably_ returns to your pocket shortly after you spend it. You can't seem to get rid of it.                                            |
| **6** | **Alchemical Tattoo** | A dog, cat, or bird that can leave your body on demand. It follows your commands to the best of its abilities, and can pass its injuries (_as STR loss_) back onto you. |
