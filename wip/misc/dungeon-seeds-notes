- Consider what lies beyond those corridors, and what clues they might have left behind? Is there a change in elevation? Is air a different temperature? Is the light, smell, or sound distinct from where the characters are standing? 
- How close is a character to a potential danger? Are they above it, or below it? What side of an object are they standing on? Are they inside of or outside of a room, building, or structure?
