- Establish a theme
- Find inspiration
- Use examples from real life
- Do it however you can do it
- Be ready to change it- a lot
- Stock the rooms
- Encounter tables
- Be specific
- Don't assume

- Consider what lies beyond those corridors, and what clues they might have left behind? Is there a change in elevation? Is air a different temperature? Is the light, smell, or sound distinct from where the characters are standing? 
- How close is a character to a potential danger? Are they above it, or below it? What side of an object are they standing on? Are they inside of or outside of a room, building, or structure?
- Say, "a long, jagged knife" rather than "an evil-looking knife."
