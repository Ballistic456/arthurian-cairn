## Reliquary

## Coin of the Father, 1 charge

- Flip this worthless-looking hunk of flat metal in the air and it will appear to transform into a far more valuable coin. The illusion ends a few minutes later.
- **Recharge**: Steal the coin from its most recent recipient.

## Barbed Epaulets, +1 Armor

- Spiked shoulder pads that cause d4 STR damage to anyone who grabs you.
