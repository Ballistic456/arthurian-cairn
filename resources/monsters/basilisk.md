# Basilisk

10 HP, 1 Armor, 12 STR, 13 DEX, 13 WIL, bite (d10)

- Long, serpentine lizards that nest deep below the earth or in brambles just underfoot. 
- Fighting a **Basilisk** without meeting its gaze is difficult (attacks facing it are _impaired_).
- **Gaze**: A target facing the Basilisk is slowly turned to stone, from the bottom up. After three rounds, they petrify completely. Its reflection is harmless. An antidote can be brewed from the Basilisk's gizzards.
