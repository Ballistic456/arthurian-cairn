# Medusa

10 HP, 8 STR, 12 DEX, 16 WIL, snake bites (d6+d4) or gaze (save)

- Magical creatures that resemble humanoid women, but have snakes in place of hair. Proud and territorial. 
- Those who gaze upon the eyes of the Medusa are quickly turned to stone (its reflection is harmless). Attacks against it are almost always _impaired_.
- If severed, a Medusaâ€™s head maintains its powers for a full day.
