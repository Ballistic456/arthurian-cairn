## Class Features
### Literate (Ogham)
- You can read, write and understand spoken Latin.
### Dowse
- You may spend one dungeon turn to  _dowse_ with dowsing rods to find people, places or things.
- You must hold both rods, one in each hand. They will either point togther in one direction (towards what you seek), away from one another (not found), or will cross (found).
- Dowsing requires calm and concentration. If your concentration is broken for any reason other than finding what you seek, gain one fatigue.
- False readings are possible, often leading the dowser to water. If this is you unintended fate, gain one fatigue.
### Commune
- May talk with Neutral-aligned non-humans _in private_ once per session - ask the DM to accomodate.
### Clairvoyant
- May change any single dice to its maximum or minimum value at any time during the game, no matter who rolled it.
- This will _curse_ the main beneficiary(s) and the norns will seek to rebalance fate.
### Heathen
- You dress in ways which civilised people find either pitiful or disturbing - choose one.
